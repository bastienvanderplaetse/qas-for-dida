# Text-mining for DIDA publications
Project realised in the context of my Scientific Research Trip in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles.

[DIDA](http://dida.ibsquare.be/) is a novel database created by Andrea Gazzo and colleagues at [IB²](http://ibsquare.be/) in 2017. Its goal is to provide detailed information about digenic diseases, as well as as the variants and genes involved.

The main purpose of this work was to help to automate the update process of this database. Two essentials questions can be asked concerning the maintenance of DIDA :
1. *Which publications contain relevant information for DIDA?*
What are the important characteristics that differentiate relevant publications from the others? How can we identify and classify them?
2. *How to find publications relevant to evaluate the current information in DIDA ?*
How to extract information from publications ? How can we check if this information is not in contradiction with the data in DIDA? Does this new data provide additional proof for information already in DIDA?

This work had as objective the evaluation of intelligent approaches that could be used to solve the first question. Two studies were performed that provide answers :
1.  Investigating the relevance of Text Mining approaches.
2.  Using Question Answering systems to  evaluate the article relevance.

This repository is focused on Question Answering systems approaches.
Text Mining approach is available at : [https://github.com/bastienvanderplaetse/text-mining-for-dida](https://github.com/bastienvanderplaetse/text-mining-for-dida)

The explanations of the models can be found in the report related to this project.
