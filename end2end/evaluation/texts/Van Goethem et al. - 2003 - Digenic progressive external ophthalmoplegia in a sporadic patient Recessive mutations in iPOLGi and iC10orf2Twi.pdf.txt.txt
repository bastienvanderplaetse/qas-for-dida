HUMAN MUTATION 22:175^176 (2003) LETTER TO THE EDITORS Digenic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia in a Sporadic Patient: Recessive Mutations in POLG and C10orf2/Twinkle Gert Van Goethem,1,2 Ann Lo¨fgren,1 Bart Dermaut,1 Chantal Ceuterick,3 Jean-Jacques Martin,2,3 and Christine Van Broeckhoven1n 1Department of Molecular Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, Born-Bunge Foundation, University of Antwerp, Antwerpen, Belgium; 2Division of Neurology, University Hospital of Antwerp, Antwerpen, Belgium; 3Laboratory of Neuropathology, Born-Bunge Foundation, University of Antwerp, Department of Medicine, Antwerpen, Belgium Communicated by Arnold Munnich deletions Recently several mutations have been identified in nuclear genes that predispose to autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with multiple of mitochondrial DNA In autosomal dominant PEO (adPEO, (mtDNA) MIM# 157640), mutations were reported in the genes ANT1 (MIM# 103220; encoding the heart-muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator) [Kauko- nen et al., 2000], C10orf2 (MIM# 606075; encoding the novel mitochondrial protein Twinkle) [Spelbrink et al., 2001], and POLG (MIM# 174763; encoding the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma) [Van Goethem et al., 2001].
In recessive PEO, mutations have been identified in POLG [Van Goethem et al., 2001, 2003; Lamantea et al., 2002] and in ECGF1 (MIM# 131222; encoding thymidine phosphorylase) [Nishino et al., 1999.
ECGF1 mutations specifically caused mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalo- myopathy (MNGIE, MIM# 603041), a subgroup of arPEO that is characterized by leukodystrophy [Nishino et al., 2000; Vissing et al., 2002] We here report a novel C10orf2 mutation co-occurring with a previously reported recessive POLG mutation in a sporadic PEO patient with multiple mtDNA deletions Direct sequencing of all coding exons demonstrated a heterozygous mutation in POLG (c.2542G4A), corre- sponding with the G848S substitution [Lamantea et al., 2002], and a novel heterozygous mutation in C10orf2 (c.1031G4A), predicting a R334Q substitution in Twinkle.
Both mutations were absent in 180 Belgian control chromosomes.
Neither were mutations found in ANT1.
The corresponding residue of Twinkle R334 in phage T7 gp4 is located in the primase domain, and the residue is conserved in mouse and Drosophila Clinical onset in the patient was at 52 years with blepharoptosis, depression, and levodopa responsive Parkinson disease.
Later she suffered from severe dysphagia leading to cachexia and necessitating enteric feeding.
On examination, she had dysarthria, mild ophthalmoparesis, generalized myopathy, and extra- pyramidal signs.
Nerve conduction studies were normal rr2003 WILEY-LISS, INC and needle-electromyography showed neurogenic signs Muscle biopsy demonstrated one ragged red fiber on modified trigomori stain and histochemistry revealed no cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers.
Electron micro- scopy showed an increased number of both subsarco- lemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria, often with abnormally shaped cristae and inclusions of type I crystals and dense granules.
Southern blot analysis of muscle DNA revealed low proportions of multiple deleted mtDNA molecules.
Serum lactate was normal.CT-scan of the brain was normal and MRI of the brain could not be interpreted due to severe movement artifacts.
At 66 years of age sudden death occurred, which was attributed to a cardiac arrest The co-occurrence of a POLG G848S substitution with the Twinkle R334Q substitution in a PEO patient is unlikely a coincidence in view of the absence of both mutations in controls.
In the heterozygote state, the G848S mutation in POLG causes no clinical phenotype, but in combination with another mutation in POLG, it results in recessive PEO [Lamantea et al., 2002].
Until now, all C10orf2 mutations were dominant mutations, and many occurred in the same region as R334Q, including a mutation (P335L) that altered the adjacent amino acid residue in an Australian PEO family [Spelbrink et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2002].
Here, the data are indicative of a recessive nature of Twinkle R334Q in our PEO patient, though family history information was limited by the early death (age 40 years) of the patient’s father.
Her mother, who appeared unaffected in photographs and was reportedly healthy, died at 95 years of age.

Our observations warrant sequencing of all nuclear PEO genes in sporadic PEO patients with multiple mtDNA deletions.
This finding may be the first indication of a digenic disorder of mtDNA maintenance Since little is known about the function of Twinkle, the precise molecular mechanism that leads to mtDNA deletions in this patient remains unclear.
Speculations about a potential physical interaction between polymer- ase gamma and Twinkle are premature as mtDNA deletions might also result from a mere additive effect of the altered polymerase gamma and Twinkle proteins Further, levodopa responsive Parkinsonism has been reported in different sporadic and familial PEO cases with multiple mtDNA deletions [Lamantea et al., 2002; Checcarelli et al., 1994; Chalmers et al., 1996; Casali et al., 2001; Cottrell et al., 2000].
