PURPOSE.Autosomal recessive ocular albinism (AROA) is a group of genetic disorders in which reduced pigmentation of the eye is associated with decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, and photophobia, although pigmentation of skin and hair is relatively normal.
Previous studies have shown that AROA in some cases constitutes a clinically mild presentation of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), due to mutations in either the TYR (OCA1) or OCA2 (P) genes.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the relative prevalence of different genetic forms of AROA, and to characterize a sample repertoire of gene mutations in a large series of Caucasian patients with AROA METHODS.
Thirty-six unrelated Caucasian patients carrying the clinical diagnosis of AROA were studied by DNA sequence analysis of the four classic OCA genes: TYR, OCA2 (P), TYRP1, and SLC45A2 (MATP), as appropriate.
In all patients with no apparent pathologic mutations in these genes, DNA sequence analysis was performed of a candidate OCA gene, SILV, and the two genes most often involved in Hermansky-Pudlak syn- drome, HPS1 and HPS4, the most frequent syndromic form of OCA RESULTS.
TYR gene mutations were identiﬁed in 20 (56%) pa- tients, OCA2 mutations in 3 (8%), mutations in both TYR and OCA2 in 2 (6%), and possible TYRP1 mutations in 2 (6%).
In at least nine patients, no mutations were found in any of the genes studied.
Almost all patients with OCA1-related AROA were compound heterozygous for severe OCA1 mutant alleles and the common R402Q variant CONCLUSIONS.
Most patients with AROA represent phenotypi- cally mild variants of OCA, well over half of which is OCA1 (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

OA1 re- sults from mutations in the OA1 locus.2 AROA, in at least some cases, results from mutations in TYR3 or OCA2,4 two of the 18 genes involved in the more severe oculocutaneous albinism (reviewed in Ref.
5).AROA in these patients thus represents clinically mild variants of oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1; OMIM 203100) and type 2 (OCA2; OMIM 203200) One patient with AROA has been reported to have de novo deletion of region q13-q15 of chromosome 66 (OMIM 203310), although no pigmentary genes in this genomic region have yet been identiﬁed We have shown that patients with TYR-related AROA may be compound heterozygous for various severe OCA1 muta- tions on one allele, the other allele carrying a polymorphic variant of the TYR gene, rs1126809, that is quite common among Caucasians, with allele frequency ⬃0.278 (Ref.
7 and dbSNP; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs⫽ 1126809).
The rs1126809 variant encodes a tyrosinase enzyme with an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 402 (R402Q3), resulting in a tyrosinase polypeptide that is thermo- labile7 and subject to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum,8 yielding only 25% of the catalytic activity of wild-type enzyme at 37°C.7 Patients with TYR-related AROA thus have total ty- rosinase catalytic activity ⬃12% to 13% of normal.
One unique family segregates AROA along with Waardenburg syndrome type 2, the result of digenic inheritance of the TYR402Q allele and a frameshift mutation of MITF, resulting in simultaneous downregulation of TYR transcription and the thermolabile R402Q tyrosinase.9 OCA2-related AROA4,10 appears to be less frequent, but these patients likewise are compound heterozy- gous for one severe OCA2 allele and the other allele having a mutation with only modest negative effect on function.11 All published studies to date have described molecular anal- yses of patients with AROA on a gene-by-gene basis, precluding assessment of either the relative frequencies of the different types of AROA or of different gene mutations.
Furthermore, it is possible that in some patients AROA results from mutations of other genes associated with other types of albinism, such as OCA3, OCA4, and perhaps the various types of Hermansky- Pudlak syndrome (HPS) or other syndromic forms of OCA.5 In this article, we describe comprehensive molecular genetic analysis of 36 unrelated Caucasian patients with the clinical diagnosis of AROA, yielding insight into the relative prevalence of different types of AROA and a repertoire of pathologic gene mutations in this group METHODS Subjects and Diagnostic Criteria A total of 36 unrelated Caucasian patients were studied.
All were referred for molecular analysis to the investigator by their respective ophthalmologists, each carrying the presumptive clinical diagnosis of autosomal recessive ocular albinism.
Six of the patients were also examined clinically by the investigator.
Patients’ clinical data are pre- sented in Supplementary Table S1, http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/ full/49/3/868/DC1.
All patients had various ophthalmic features typical of AROA, including reduced visual acuity, iris transillumination, pho- tophobia, nystagmus, strabismus, hypopigmented retinas, and abnor- Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, March 2008, Vol.

All patients had normal pigmentation of the skin and hair, though most, but not all, were relatively lightly complected in comparison with their families.
Patients with mutations in the OA1 gene were excluded.
This study conformed to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved as a no-consent study by the Combined Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) of the Univer- sity of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center on the grounds that only archived samples were used for the original purpose for which the samples were obtained Molecular Genetic Analyses DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes and quantiﬁed (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer; NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
For patients with less than 30 ng/␮L DNA, whole-genome ampli- ﬁcation was performed (REPLI-g Midi Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the products quantiﬁed (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Quantiﬁcation Kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) For each patient, amplicons containing each exon and adjacent ﬂanking regions of the TYR, OCA2 (P), TYRP1, and SLC45A2 (MATP) genes, the 5⬘ promoter regions of TYR (1555 nucleotides [nt], exclud- ing a simple sequence repeat from nt 88549828-88550258) and OCA2, and a conserved 647-bp segment located 8989 bp upstream from the TYR major mRNA 5⬘ terminus that may represent a locus control region,12 were ampliﬁed by touchdown PCR for DNA sequencing.
For patients with no apparent pathologic mutations in any of these genes, amplicons containing each exon of the HPS1, HPS4, and SILV genes were then ampliﬁed for sequencing (in many patients DNA sequencing of multiple genes was performed in parallel).
PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2, http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/full/49/3/ 868/DC1.
PCRs were performed in 25-␮L volumes containing 30 ng DNA, 5 pmols of each primer, 2.5 ␮L of 10⫻ PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 M betaine, 0.2 mM dNTPs (GeneAmp dNTP Blend; Applied Biosystems, Inc.
