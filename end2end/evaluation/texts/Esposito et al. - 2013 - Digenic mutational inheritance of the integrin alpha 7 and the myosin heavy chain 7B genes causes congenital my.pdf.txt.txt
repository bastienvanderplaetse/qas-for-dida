Abstract Background: We report an Italian family in which the proband showed a severe phenotype characterized by the association of congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) with a left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC).
This study was focused on the identification of the responsible gene/s Methods and results: Using the whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified the proband homozygous missense mutations in two genes, the myosin heavy chain 7B (MYH7B) and the integrin alpha 7 (ITGA7).
Both genes are expressed in heart and muscle tissues, and both mutations were predicted to be deleterious and were not found in the healthy population The R890C mutation in the MYH7B gene segregated with the LVNC phenotype in the examined family.
It was also found in one unrelated patient affected by LVNC, confirming a causative role in cardiomyopathy The E882K mutation in the ITGA7 gene, a key component of the basal lamina of muscle fibers, was found only in the proband, suggesting a role in CFTD Conclusions: This study identifies two novel disease genes.
Mutation in MYH7B causes a classical LVNC phenotype, whereas mutation in ITGA7 causes CFTD.
Both phenotypes represent alterations of skeletal and cardiac muscle maturation and are usually not severe.
The severe phenotype of the proband is most likely due to a synergic effect of these two mutations This study provides new insights into the genetics underlying Mendelian traits and demonstrates a role for digenic inheritance in complex phenotypes Keywords: Left ventricular noncompact cardiomyopathy, Congenital type fiber disproportion, Integrin alpha 7 (ITGA7), Myosin heavy chain 7B (MYH7B), Whole exome sequencing * Correspondence: teresa.esposito@igb.cnr.it 1Institute of Genetics and Biophysics “Adriano Buzzati-Traverso”, National Research Council of Italy, Naples, Italy Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © 2013 Esposito et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:91 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/91 Page 2 of 13 Background Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a form of congenital myopathy in which consistent type 1 fiber hypotrophy relative to type 2 fibers is the main histological abnormality [1].
The health impairments commonly en- countered in CFTD are similar to those of many other congenital myopathies.
Muscle weakness is usually rela- tively stable or slowly progressive during childhood and adolescence.
In general, scoliosis and joint contractures (other than mild Achilles tendon contractures) are rela- tively uncommon.
Mutations associated with CFTD have been found in the TPM3 (MIM# 191030), ACTA1 (MIM# 102610), SEPN1 (MIM# 606210), RYR1 (MIM# 180901), TPM2 (MIM# 190990) and MYH7 (MIM# 160760) genes [2-8].
Despite recent advances, no genetic cause has been found in at least 50% of CFTD patients Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) has been reported in patients with different types of neuro- muscular disorders but has never been associated with CFTD.
Within the last 2 decades, more than 200 cases of LVNC have been described [9].
The hallmark features of this cardiomyopathy include prominent trabeculations and deep endocardial recesses.
Symptoms associated with LVNC are variable and can include arrhythmias, thrombo- embolic events and heart failure.
At least 4 genes that cause very rare cardiomyopathy diseases have been found to be linked to non-syndromic LVNC in familial or spor- adic cases.
Thus far, the X-linked gene known as G4.5 or taffazin (TAZ) has been found to be associated with the largest number of LVNC cases [10].
Other genes found to be mutated in LVNC include alpha-dystrobrevin (DTNA), Cypher/ZASP and lamin A/C [11-13].
Cumulatively, these genes have been shown to be associated with only a small percentage of sporadic or familial cases.
Over the past few years, mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), alpha-cardiac actin (ACTC1), cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), cardiac myosin- binding protein C (MYBPC3), alpha-tropomyosin (TMP1) and cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) have been identified in a significant proportion of patients with LVNC [14-16] We report an Italian family in which the proband showed a severe disease phenotype characterized by CFTD and LVNC.
The clinical and instrumental analysis of the family members identified the LVNC phenotype in the mother, the sister and the first-degree cousin of the proband, suggesting that the LVNC cardiomyopathy segregated as a dominant mode of inheritance with high pheno- typic heterogeneity and reduced penetrance.
CFTD pheno- type showed a recessive mode of inheritance To our knowledge, this is the first example of LVNC cardiac phenotype associated with CFTD.
We provide a full description of this new phenotype and of the identi- fication of the disease-causing genes by whole-exome sequencing [17] Patients and methods Family and unrelated cohort A single, multigenerational Italian pedigree was involved in this investigation, as depicted in Figure 1.
Phenotypic data were available for 10 individuals (3 males and 7 females) ranging in age from 4 to 50.
All individuals were of Caucasian ancestry.
DNA was available for 6 individuals (IV-10, IV-13, IV-14, V-1, V-4, V-5).
We extended the clinical and instrumental (EMG, ECG, Echocardiography, muscle biopsy) evaluation to the whole family.
We identi- fied a mild LVNC phenotype (according to the Jenni cri- teria) in the mother (IV-14), sister (V-5) and cousin (V-1) of the proband, with hypertabeculations of the mid inferolateral wall and of the ape and without neuro- muscular disorders [18].
During the growth, there was a reduction of clinical signs in patients V-1 and V-5 No data have been collected for individual IV-9, who died at the age of 35 of unknown causes.
The father (IV-13) of the proband was asymptomatic An unrelated cohort (UC) of 24 patients (including LVNC14-BG), all fulfilling the criteria for LVNC, were also analyzed in this study Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
In the case of minors, parental consent was obtained.
The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as reflected in the a priori approval by the institution’s human research committee Whole-exome sequencing strategy For all participants over 18 years of age, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood specimens using a standard salting- out procedure.
Genomic DNA samples from two affected females in the pedigree (the proband V-4, affected by CFTD and LVNC, and her cousin V-1, affected by LVNC) were captured with the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome™ capture kits (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)) and se- quenced with one lane per sample on an Illumina GAIIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with 90-bp paired- end reads Sequences were aligned to the human reference genome sequence (GRCh37/hg19) with the MAQ7 and NextGENe software v2.00 with sequence condensation by consolida- tion (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA).
This approach resulted in more than 40× of target exome coverage Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called with MAQ and NextGENe.
Small insertions and deletions were de- tected with NextGENe.
Called SNVs were annotated with SeattleSeq Annotation and filtered with dbSNP130 Mutation analysis A mutation analysis of already-known genes for CFTD and LVNC and validation and segregation analyses of the selected variants obtained from exome sequencing, were performed by Sanger sequencing Esposito et al.

The proband affected by CFTD and LVNC is indicated with an arrow and a dark circle The mother, sister and cousin of the proband, affected by LVNC, are indicated with gray circles Each variant was amplified and sequenced, as described in our previous studies [19,20].
Variations were detected by multiple-sequence alignments using the Autoassembler program (Applied Biosystems) The SIFT and PolyPhen2 software packages (http://sift.bii a-star.edu.sg/www/SIFT_seq_submit2.html, http://genetics bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) were used to assess the deleteri- ous effects of the mutations To assess the minor allele frequencies of the variants, the dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) and the 1000 Genomes (http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/) da- tabases were surveyed Expression analysis To examine the expression pattern of the MYH7B and ITGA7 genes, real-time PCR was performed on total RNAs from human adult tissues purchased from Stratagene and on total RNAs derived from the blood of family members using the LightCycler system DNA Engine Opticon 2 (MJ Research).
The detailed protocol has already been pub- lished [21,22] The expression levels were normalized to glyceralde- hyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to account for differences in the starting material and in the cDNA re- action efficiency.
Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to further confirm the specific PCR products The MYH7B and ITGA7 transcript primers were the following: MYH7B-cDNA-F 5′ GTCTGGGTGCCTGATGAACA 3′ MYH7B-cDNA-R 5′ CTCGTTCAGGTGCGTCATCA 3′ ITGA7-IS1-F 5′ GGATGGTGGGGAATGGAAGT 3′ ITGA7-IS1-R 5′ GGTCAGCAGGGTCCAAAGTT 3′ ITGA7-IS2-R 5′ GCGGGGGTCCTGCTCTTCT 3′ ITGA7-IS3-F 5′ CAGAGGCAGGCAGAAGGATT 3′ The primer ITGA7-IS2-R was combined with either ITGA7-IS1-F or ITGA7-IS3-F The GAPDH primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′ AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC 3′, and reverse primer, 5′ GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG 3′ Results Clinical features of patient V-4 The proband (V-4) is the first child of a family with a his- tory of consanguinity (mother’s parents are first-degree cousins) and diabetes in the maternal line (grandmother, one great-uncle, one uncle and a first-degree cousin) with- out neuromuscular diseases (Figure 1).
Since birth, she manifested hypotonia, poor sucking and persistent crying Persistent arterial duct and patent foramen ovale were diagnosed at birth but resolved spontaneously, as shown Esposito et al.
Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:91 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/91 Page 4 of 13 by echocardiography at the age of 1 month.
At 3 months of age, she was diagnosed with congenital dislocation of the left hip, and at 17 months of age, she was hospital- ized because of body weight below the third percentile and hypoglycemia.
The failure to thrive was due to diffi- culties in chewing and swallowing.
ECG showed a long QTc (478 msec).
Echocardiography showed a slight left ventricular (LV) dilatation, a moderate reduction of the LV global function (ejection fraction 40%), and a non- compacted aspect of the overall infero-lateral wall.
She was administered ace-inhibitors, diuretics and digitalis, with a significant improvement in the clinical state.
The karyotype and FISH were normal.
The serum creatine kinase (CK) was within the normal range.
The patient was followed up for 8 years At 8 years of age, she was admitted at our department for a neuromuscular and cardiological evaluation The neurologic examination revealed the following: a waddling gait, an inability to stand up from a sitting pos- ition, a slight degree of weakness of the facial and mastica- tor muscles, a mild weakness of the glutei and ileo-psoas and marked bilateral quadriceps.
She developed marked scoliosis due to congenital hip dysplasia (Figure 2).
Ten- don reflexes were absent.
Joints contractures had never been observed.
A blood test confirmed hypoglycemia and Figure 2 The proband at 10 years of age.
Note the marked scoliosis, the leg length discrepancy and the left quadriceps hypotrophy; the abduction and elevation of the arms are impaired normal levels of serum creatine kinase and isoenzymes An EEG and a brain MRI showed no abnormality.
A quadriceps muscle biopsy displayed a predominance of type 1 fibers (76%), the mean diameter of which was 30% smaller than that of the type 2 fibers; the latter were hypertrophic for the age (mean diameter of 35 μm) (Figure 3).
No internal nuclei, nemaline bodies or cores were observed.
Dystrophin, emerin, calpain and lamin A/C were examined and found to be normal.
This allowed us to exclude other neuromuscular disorders associated with the myopathy.
These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of CFTD The cardiological investigation confirmed a long QTc and showed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and re- polarization abnormalities in the ECG.
The echocardiog- raphy showed a dilated left ventricle (left ventricular end diastolic diameter z-score +3) with hypertrabeculation of the antero-lateral, postero-lateral and inferior walls (non-compacted/compacted ratio ~3), a severe impair- ment of the LV global function (ejection fraction 35%), a moderate mitral regurgitation, an abnormal mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio 0.8), and a mild increase in the pulmon- ary artery pressure (40 mmHg) with normal non-invasive pulmonary wedge pressure (E/Ea ratio 8) (Figures 4A and 4B).
A 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring revealed 5 short runs of supraventricular tachycardias.
The patient was administered with carvedilol and ace-inhibitors, with the prescription of routine cardiac evaluations (every 4–6 months) At the last cardiological evaluation (10 years of age), she was asymptomatic for dyspnoea (NYHA class I) and in therapy with carvedilol 6.25 mg ½ cp 2 times/day, losartan 50 mg ½ cp/day, spironolattone 25 mg ½ cp/day, furosemide 25 mg 1 cp/day and cardioaspirin 100 mg 1cp/day.
The ECG confirmed a prolonged QTc (485 msec), and the echocardiography showed a non-compacted LV with 38% ejection fraction and slightly elevated pulmon- ary artery pressure (45 mmHg).
NT-proBNP was elevated (1858 pg/ml).
A cardiac MRI analysis confirmed the diag- nosis of LVNC, with a significant reduction of ejection fraction to 40% (Figure 4C) One month before the cardiovascular appointment, the patient (11 years old) died suddenly early in the morning, while lying in bed Gene identification strategy Whole-exome sequencing of the proband, affected by CFTD and LVNC, and her cousin, affected by LVNC, was used as a strategy to identify the responsible gene/s At first, we performed a thorough survey of all previ- ously identified CFTD and LVNC genes to definitively exclude their involvement in the disease phenotype.
Only intronic polymorphic variants were detected in TPM3, ACTA1, TPM2, MYL2, MYL3, G4.5, DTNA, ZASP, ACTC1, Esposito et al.

(A) H-E: moderate fiber caliber variability and diffuse mild fibrosis; (B) Trichrome of Gomori: absence of mitochondrial accumulation; (C) NADH-Tr: no oxidative enzymes change; (D) ATPase pH 4.3: a clear predominance of type I (dark) fibers, which show diameters smaller than those of type 2 fibers (clear) MYBPC3 and TMP1.
Both intronic and coding poly- morphic variants were detected in SEPN1, RYR1, MYH7, LMNA/C, TNNT2 and TNNI3 (Table 1).
After filtering the data with dbSNP130 and data from six in-house exomes (1 healthy individual and 5 individuals with un- related diseases; Table 2), we performed two models of analysis to follow both phenotypes: LVNC that segre- gated as dominant and CFTD that showed a recessive mode of inheritance.
For the dominant model, we matched data from both individuals (V-1/V-4) to obtain shared vari- ants.
In total, 93 autosomal non-synonymous coding vari- ants were shared between the two samples.
Only 56 of these variants were confirmed by direct sequencing in the two patients.
Ten variants showed complete segregation with the LVNC phenotype in the family but were also found in the healthy population with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >1%.
Only one of these, R890C in myosin, heavy chain 7B, cardiac muscle, beta (MYH7B), was found in the 1000 Genomes database with a MAF < 0.05% and was pre- dicted to be a deleterious change by bioinformatics tools For the recessive model, only the proband was consid- ered to be affected.
We then selected all genes carrying two mutations.
In total, 46 homozygous changes were selected, but only 10 were confirmed by direct sequen- cing and analyzed in the family samples.
It is important to note that the parents of individual IV-14 (mother of the proband) are first-degree cousins, so she is homozy- gous for many variants and represents a good sample to filter data derived from the proband.
In fact, 9 of the 10 variants were excluded because they were homozygous both in the proband and in her mother, who did not show the CFTD phenotype.
Only the E882K variant, in the integrin, alpha 7 (ITGA7) gene, segregated with the CFTD phenotype in the family The compound heterozygous model produced 50 genes, of which only 5 continued to carry two mutations after direct sequencing analysis; none of the 50 genes segre- gated with the disease phenotype in the family because they were also present in the sister of the proband (V5), who showed no CFTD phenotype Esposito et al.

The nucleotide substitution c.2668 C > T is located in exon 27 and causes the non-synonymous change of the amino acid arginine at position 890 into cysteine (R890C) The inheritance of the R890C mutation was examined by Sanger sequencing of the DNA of the family individuals (Figure 5A).
It was found to be homozygous in samples IV-14 and V-4 and to be heterozygous in IV-13, V-1 and V-5; it was absent in IV-10.
This finding suggests the segregation of the mutation with the LVNC disease pheno- type in our family; however, its reduced penetrance and variable expressivity need to be considered because the mutation is also carried by the asymptomatic subject IV-13.
To further validate our finding, we analyzed the R890C mutation in a panel of 24 unrelated LVNC patients from the same geographical area and found it in patient Esposito et al.
