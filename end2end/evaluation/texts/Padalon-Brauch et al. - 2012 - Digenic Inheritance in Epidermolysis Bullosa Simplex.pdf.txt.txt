EB simplex (EBS) is the most common form of EB and the first keratin disorder whose genetic basis was elucidated in humans (Uitto et al., 2007) in other genes EBS has been associated with muta- tions in at least eight distinct genes (Intong and Murrell, 2012).
Although the very rare forms of superficial EBS have been associated with mutations in PKP1 and DSP encoding plakophilin 1 and desmoplakin (Jonkman et al., 2005; McGrath and Mellerio, 2010), the more common type of EBS is usually due to mutations in KRT5 and KRT14 encoding basal cell keratins (Sprecher, 2010), although it is occasionally caused by mutations including PLEC1, ITGA6, ITGB4, and DST (Jonk- man et al., 2002; Pfendner et al., 2005a; Groves et al., 2010).
K5 and K14 assemble into 10-nm keratin intermedi- ate filaments that underlie the formation of the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells (Candi et al., 2005).
Most KRT5 and KRT14 mutations have been shown to disrupt the central a-helical segment of these molecules, thereby leading to reduced resistance to mechanical stress and skin blistering, although other mechanisms may underlie rare pheno- types caused by mutations affecting less well-conserved areas of the keratin molecules (Uttam et al., 1996; Gu et al., 2003; Sprecher et al., 2003) EBS caused by mutations in KRT5 or KRT14 is usually inherited as an auto- somal dominant trait.
Occasionally, especially in populations characterized by an elevated coefficient of inbreed- ing, autosomal recessive inheritance is common (Abu Sa’d et al., 2006).
In the present report, we describe a hitherto reported form of recessive inheritance in EBS A 2-year-old boy of Jewish Ashkenazi origin was referred to our outpatient clinic because of widespread congenital skin blistering (EBS—other generalized) His parents noticed marked exacerba- tion during the summer months.
His mother as well as maternal grandfather reported a similar but significantly milder phenotype.
These two indivi- duals demonstrated blisters, mostly dur- ing the summer period and exclusively located on the soles.
The grandparents of the proband confirmed that his mother was only mildly affected from early childhood.
The father of the proband was totally asymptomatic.
On examination, tensed bullae were ob- served over the dorsal surface of the feet, the legs (Figure 1a), and along the trunk.
No milia, mucosal involvement, or nail dystrophy were observed.
Exam- ination of the mother and maternal grandfather of the proband failed on several occasions to reveal active signs of disease.
A skin biopsy showed sub- epidermal blister formation, whereas immunohistochemical staining demon- strated keratin staining at the base and roof of the blister (not shown) The family provided written and informed consent according to a proto- col approved by the National Commit- tee for Genetic Studies of the Israeli Ministry of Health in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the 5 Prime ArchivePure DNA Blood Kit (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) to explain the striking phenotypic discre- pancy between the proband and other affected members of his family, we screened all family members for muta- tions in KRT5 and KRT14.
Genomic DNA was PCR-amplified using primer pairs spanning the entire coding se- In an attempt Abbreviations: cDNA, complementary DNA; EB, epidermolysis bullosa; EBS, EB simplex 2852 Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012), Volume 132 quence, as well as intron–exon bound- aries of KRT5 and KRT14, as previously described (Whittock et al., 2000; Ciu- botaru et al., 2003) The proband and his asymptomatic father were found to carry a hetero- zygous G-A transition at position 1163 of the KRT14 complementary DNA (cDNA).
This mutation results in the substitution of a histidine for an arginine at amino acid position 388 (p.R388H, Figure 1b).
This mutation has previously been associated with recessive inheri- tance of EBS in a compound hetero- zygous state (Ciubotaru et al., 2003).
In addition, the proband was found to carry a heterozygous T-C transition at posi- tion 548 of the KRT5 cDNA.
This mutation results in the substitution of threonine for isoleucine, p.I183T (Figure 1b), affecting a highly conserved amino- acid residue (Figure 1d, Conseq¼ 9, range 1–9; http://conseq.tau.ac.il/) of predicted functional importance (Poly- Phen-2¼ 1, range 1–0, http://genet- ics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/index.shtml; SIFT¼ 0, range 1–0, http://sift.jcvi.org/) The mildly affected mother and maternal grandfather of the proband also carried the same mutation in a heterozygous state (Figure 1b).
Using PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism assays, we confirmed segregation of the muta- tions with the disease phenotype in the family (Figure 1c) and excluded p.I183T from a panel of 200 population-matched control individuals (400 alleles) The two missense mutations identi- fied in this study, p.I183T and p.R388H, are both located in highly conserved regions within the 1A domain of K5 and 2B domain of K14, respectively.
As the two molecules form under physio- logical heterodimer (Coulombe et al., 2009), the presence of mutations in both K5 and K14 is likely to aggravate the consequences of each separate mutation.
p.R388H has been reported previously in three cases of EBS.
In the first study, it was shown that p.R388H causes EBS-Weber conditions a G Padalon-Brauch et al Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex c 259 bp 176 bp 762 bp 652 bp I II III 1 131 181 231 1 1 2 K5 K14 141 191 241 d 101 151 201 111 161 211 121 171 221 The conservation scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Variable Average Conserved - An exposed residue according to the neural-network algorithm - A buried residue according to the neural-network algorithm - A predicted functional residue (highly conserved and exposed) - A predicted structural residue (highly conserved and buried) - Insufficient data—the calculation for this site was   performed on <10% of the sequences a b K5 K14 T C A N C G A T C C G C T G I183T R388H T C A T C Proband (III-1) G A T C C G C T G Wild type R388H Father (II-1) T C A N C G A T C C G C T G I183T Wild type Mother (II-2) Figure 1.
Clinical features and molecular analysis in a family with epidermolysis bullosa simplex.(a) Severe and widespread blistering in patient III-1.
(b) Sequence analysis reveals a heterozygous G4A at complementary DNA (cDNA) position 1163 of the KRT14 gene in the proband (upper panel) and his asymptomatic father (middle panel) resulting in p.R388H substitution, as well as a heterozygous T4C transition at cDNA position 548 of the KRT5 gene resulting in p.I183T substitution in the proband (upper panel) and his mother (lower panel); the p.I183T and p.R388H are marked with an arrow.
(c) To confirm segregation of mutation p.I183T with the disease in the family, a 259-bp-long PCR-amplified DNA fragment (forward primer 50-CAAATCGACCCCAGCATCCA-30; reverse primer 50-CAGT CTAATTCAGAACGTGTCC-30) was digested overnight at 65 1C with DNA endonuclease TaqaI: carriers of the mutation display a 259-bp fragment, whereas noncarriers show a 176-bp fragment only.
To confirm segregation of mutation p.R388H with the disease in the family, we used a PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism assay previously described (Ciubotaru et al., 2003; Abu Sa’d et al., 2006).
(d) Conseq analysis attributes a maximal conservation score to residue I183 (http://conseq.tau.ac.il/).
I183 is marked with an arrow in the father of Cockayne in a compound heterozygous state with another nonsense mutation in KRT14 whereas it was phenotypically silent the affected children (Ciubotaru et al., 2003).
Abu Sa’d et al.
(2006) identified two patients with EBS-Weber Cockayne carrying p.R388H in a heterozygous state with no other mutations in KRT5 or KRT14, suggesting partial penetrance and/or the effect of modifying factors (Ciubotaru et al., 2003; Abu Sa’d et al., 2006) Several heterozygous mutations have previously been shown to affect codon 183 of KRT5.
The mutations p.I183F (Pfendner et al., 2005b) or p.I183M (Chamcheu et al., 2010) results in a severe form of EBS, whereas p.I183V (Glasz-Bona et al., 2009) or p.I183T (this study) results in a milder phenotype.
The severity of the phenotype is probably influenced by the size of the substituted amino acid, as phenylalanine and methionine have a larger side chain compared with valine and threonine Clearly, digenic inheritance together with other modifying traits (Titeux et al., 2008) may explain in part the highly variable phenotype typical of EB in general, and of EBS more specifically (Sprecher, 2010).
The first example of digenic inheritance of a human pheno- type was reported in a case of retinitis pigmentosa (Kajiwara et al., 1994) Since then, similar cases have been described in many monogenic disor- ders including nonsyndromic deafness, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, and Waarden- burg syndrome type II (reviewed in Badano and Katsanis, 2002) Digenic inheritance has been re- ported in a severe case of junctional EB, in which two mutations in the COL17A gene and one mutation in the LAMB3 gene were detected and found to be associated with abnormal expression of two functionally related proteins, collagen XVII and laminin 332 (Floeth and Bruckner-Tuderman, 1999) It is of interest that in this case hetero- zygous carriers of one COL17A1 muta- tion and of one LAMB3 mutation were asymptomatic (Floeth and Bruckner- Tuderman, 1999) www.jidonline.org 2853 G Padalon-Brauch et al Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex A patient with EBS and his affected mother were also found to carry mutations in two distinct EB-asso- ciated genes, KRT5 (p.E168D) and KRT14 (p.A413T) (Murrell et al., 2011).
The fact that the p.E168D in KRT5 mutation reported in this study affects a highly conserved residue, involved in another EBS-causing muta- tion (p.E168K; Muller et al., 2006), supports a potential pathogenic role for this mutation in causing a disease phenotype In contrast, p.A413T is most likely a polymorphism of no consequence, as this sequence altera- tion was found in a substantial number of healthy controls in a heterozygous state (5% of a control population); a healthy individual was found to carry p.A413T in a homozygous state; bio- informatic analysis predicts lack of effect of the p.A413T change on K14 structure; and in contrast with p A413P, p.A413T did not have any deleterious effect on keratin filament formation as assayed in vitro (Natsuga et al., 2011).
In addition, looking more carefully at the data, Murrell et al (2011) even suggested that p.A413T may have a protective effect, which in turn may explain the fact this polymorphism has been maintained through evolution.
