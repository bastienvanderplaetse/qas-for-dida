Research letter Digenic inheritance in epidermolysis bullosa simplex involving two novel mutations in KRT5 and KRT14 DOI: 10.1111/bjd.15053 DEAR EDITOR, Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a heritable skin fragility disease most commonly caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding keratin 5 and ker- atin 14 (KRT5 and KRT14).1 Keratins 5 and 14 dimerize to form intermediate ﬁlaments, which provide structure, strength and ﬂexibility to the keratinocyte cytoskeleton.
When compro- mised, they are susceptible to mechanical stress, leading to the rupture of basal keratinocytes and subsequent blistering of the epithelium.2 EBS exhibits clinical heterogeneity with three main sub- types:3 EBS localized, EBS generalized intermediate and EBS generalized severe.
The different EBS subtypes tend to correlate with the location of the mutation, and the properties of the amino acids involved in the inherited mutation.4 The highly conserved ends of the rod domain (helix boundary motifs) of KRT5 and KRT14 are crucial for correct keratin ﬁlament assem- bly, and mutations in these regions often result in severe blis- tering, whereas mutations outside of these regions tend to cause milder phenotypes of EBS.5 EBS is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and less com- monly in a recessive manner.
Digenic inheritance is where a disease phenotype results only when mutations in two differ- ent genes occur in the same individual.
Usually the products of these genes interact with each other, as keratins 5 and 14 do.
There have only been two cases described to date of digenic inheritance in EBS,6,7 and we present a third case of such an inheritance pattern seen in EBS The proband presented at the age of 4 years with a history of blistering conﬁned to the hands and feet that developed as an infant learning to walk.
The blisters were aggravated by trauma and were especially worse in summer.
A diagnosis of EBS was made clinically and conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuores- cence mapping and electron microscopy sequence NM_0004243) and KRT14 (reference sequence NM_0005264) in the proband and her nonconsanguineous parents identiﬁed Mutational (reference analysis of KRT5 (a) (b) (c) Fig 1.

SIFT9 prediction was respectively).
Muta- deleterious tionTaster10 prediction was disease causing (P-values 098 and 1, respectively).
ExAC11 frequency gave a minor allele frequency of G = 00001 in 8600 European Americans for keratin 14 Met294Thr and not detected for keratin 5 Leu155Pro.
Both par- ents were unaffected by EBS, and the proband’s half-brother was also unaffected (Fig.
1), although he carried the p.Leu155- Pro mutation.
This suggests that the mutations did not cause clinical disease on their own, and that neither mutation alone is likely to disrupt keratin function signiﬁcantly as such p.Thr151Pro,1 p.Pro152Leu12 The p.Leu155Pro mutation is in the conserved 1A region of keratin 5, and while no mutation has yet been described in the same residue, other mutations have been reported in that region, and p.Asp158Val,13 which caused EBS localized.
The original and substituted amino acids involved in our proband’s p.Leu155- Pro mutation are chemically similar amino acids (Fig.
2a) Leucine and proline are both nonpolar and hydrophobic, hence the substitution is less likely to disrupt the keratin inter- mediate ﬁlaments, which may explain why this mutation did not cause disease in the mother and the half-brother who had just this one mutation The p.Met294Thr mutation is located in the keratin 14 lin- ker 2 region, which is less critical for normal keratin forma- tion, hence not causing disease in the father who carried this mutation, despite the substitution from hydrophobic nonpolar methionine to hydrophilic and polar threonine (Fig.
2b).14 The proband inherited both recessive mutations, presenting as the EBS localized phenotype in the proband.
Under normal physiology, the keratin 5 and 14 molecules dimerize to form heterodimers, therefore mutations in both genes are likely to have worsened the consequences of each separate mutation, resulting in a digenic effect.
There have only been two other cases reported where digenic inheritance in KRT5 and KRT14 was observed in EBS, whereby variants in two different genes, when combined, result in different phenotype.
A 2-year-old boy with EBS generalized intermediate inherited p.Ile183Thr in keratin 5 from his mother, who was mildly affected with EBS localized, and p.Arg388His in keratin 14 from his unaffected father.7 A similar second case was described in which p.Arg471His in ker- atin 5 was and p.Met272Thr in keratin 14 was inherited from the mildly affected father, which resulted in EBS generalized intermediate in the proband.6 Unlike in the two previously reported digenic cases, both parents of our proband had no signs or symptoms of EBS, and only the proband was affected, whereas in the previ- ously reported cases, at least one parent was affected inherited from the unaffected mother Our study adds two novel mutations causing EBS to the growing catalogue of genotype–phenotype correlations in EBS, Research letter 263 and provides further evidence of digenic inheritance in EBS We therefore support the idea of fully sequencing genes asso- ciated with EBS to understand better the complex genetic interactions that seems to be apparent in EBS.
This, we hope, will improve our understanding of the disease, aid genetic counselling and prove useful for future personalized therapeu- tic strategies.15 Acknowledgments We thank Lyn Lloyd, Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Pathol- ogy Queensland, Royal Brisbane Hospital, for the keratin 5 and 14 sequencing 1,2 E .
