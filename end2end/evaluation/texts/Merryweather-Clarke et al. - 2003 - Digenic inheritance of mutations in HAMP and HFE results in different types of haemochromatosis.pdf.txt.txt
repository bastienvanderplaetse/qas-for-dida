INTRODUCTION Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a disease caused by inappropriate dietary iron absorption (1), and is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases affecting populations of north European origin.
Those affected by HH continue to absorb iron despite excess iron stores, resulting in accumulation of iron in various tissues including the liver, heart and pancreas, which may cause fatal organ damage during middle age or thereafter However, if excess iron stores are reduced by phlebotomy before the development of organ failure, life expectancy is normal (2) Over 80% of north European HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HH gene HFE (chromosome 6 band p22.1), and a high proportion of the remaining patients are compound heterozygotes for C282Y and the common HFE mutation H63D (3).
Depending on the population studied, 4–35% of cases presenting with the HH phenotype carry only a single C282Y or H63D allele or none at all (4).
HH is a heterogeneous disease with penetrance in C282Y homozygotes varying considerably, which has discouraged widespread *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
