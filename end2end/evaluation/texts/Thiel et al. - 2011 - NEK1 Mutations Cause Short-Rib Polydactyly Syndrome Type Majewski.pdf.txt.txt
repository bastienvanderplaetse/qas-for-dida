Brandsta¨tter,2 and Anita Rauch12 Defects of ciliogenesis have been implicated in a wide range of human phenotypes and play a crucial role in signal transduction and cell-cycle coordination.
We used homozygosity mapping in two families with autosomal-recessive short-rib polydactyly syndrome Majewski type to identify mutations in NEK1 as an underlying cause of this lethal osteochondrodysplasia.
NEK1 encodes a serine/ threonine kinase with proposed function in DNA double-strand repair, neuronal development, and coordination of cell-cycle-associated ciliogenesis.
We found that absence of functional full-length NEK1 severely reduces cilia number and alters ciliar morphology in vivo We further substantiate a proposed digenic diallelic inheritance of ciliopathies by the identiﬁcation of heterozygous mutations in NEK1 and DYNC2H1 in an additional family.
Notably, these ﬁndings not only increase the broad spectrum of ciliar disorders, but suggest a correlation between the degree of defective microtubule or centriole elongation and organization and the severity of the resulting phenotype Many key developmental processes are maintained by regulation of cell-signaling pathways.
A variety of the involved regulatory proteins localize to the cilium or the basal body of an individual cell and are important for correct body tissue patterning.1 In principle, cilia are highly conserved, dynamic organelles initiated by the location of a basal body, composed of a pair of centrioles embedded in the pericentriolar material (PCM) and the axoneme to the cytoplasmatic side of the cell membrane.2 During ciliogenesis, new axonemal subunits elongate the cilia to the distal tip.3 The assembly of the axonemal units divides the cilia into two main classes: motile cilia, with two central microtubules (9þ2), and nonmotile or primary cilia, without central microtubules (9þ0).3 The formation and maintenance of the cilium is basically mediated by the dynamic, bidirectional process of intraﬂagellular trans- port (IFT).4 Anterograde movement is driven by the heter- otrimeric kinesin 2 motor, whereas retrograde transport is mediated by cytoplasmatic dynein 2.5,6 Although most vertebrate cells form at least one single, nonmotile primary cilium, only recently have the functions of cilia become widely recognized.
