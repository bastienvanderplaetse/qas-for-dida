© John Wiley & Sons A/S.Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd, 2016 Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common congenital cerebral malformation, characterized by impaired forebrain cleavage and midline facial anomalies.
Heterozygous mutations in 14 genes have been associated with HPE and are often inherited from an unaffected parent, underlying complex genetic bases.
It is now emerging that HPE may result from a combination of multiple genetic events, rather than from a single heterozygous mutation.
To explore this hypothesis, we undertook whole exome sequencing and targeted high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify mutations in HPE subjects.
Here, we report two HPE families in which two mutations are implicated in the disease.
In the first family presenting two foetuses with alobar and semi-lobar HPE, we found mutations in two genes involved in HPE, SHH and DISP1, inherited respectively from the father and the mother.
The second reported case is a family with a 9-year-old girl presenting lobar HPE, harbouring two compound heterozygous mutations in DISP1.
Together, these cases of digenic inheritance and autosomal recessive HPE suggest that in some families, several genetic events are necessary to cause HPE.
This study highlights the complexity of HPE inheritance and has to be taken into account by clinicians to improve HPE genetic counselling Conﬂict of interest All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest in the research C.

HPE is characterized by a failure to define the midline of the forebrain and midface, with different degrees of sever- ity from a lobar brain to alobar forms associated with cyclopia.
Mild manifestations or microforms include ocular hypotelorism, microcephaly and a single cen- tral maxillary incisor (2).
The mode of inheritance of HPE has been extensively discussed in the literature, and several genetic models have been proposed: autosomal dominant transmission, autosomal recessive transmis- sion or association of mutations in multiple genes (2–5) All these studies point out a strong genetic heterogene- ity, with several causative genes identified (Table 1).
It mostly implicates heterozygous mutations in SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF1, which are considered as the four major genes involved in HPE.
Heterozygous mutations in the minor genes, GLI2, PTCH1, DISP1, FOXH1, NODAL, TDGF1, CDON, GAS1, DLL1 and FGF8, have been identified with a lower frequency (2, 7).
Recently, two recessive inheritance cases of HPE have been described, implicating mutations in the gene STIL (Table 1) (8, 9) Importantly, these genes are all involved in signalling pathways implicated in brain development (4, 9–16) and alteration of SHH signalling appears to be the most com- mon cause of HPE (17) Although the major genes have been formally involved, their penetrance is usually incomplete with an intra-familial phenotypic variability.
Actually, mutations located in these genes are inherited from a parent, asymptomatic or displaying a microform of HPE, in 70% of the cases (2).
For example, the same SHH mutation can be found in individuals harbouring either alobar HPE or minor forms (18).
Consequently, the clinical variability could be because of the abnormalities in other genes that have a function in the same or interacting signalling pathways (19, 20) This is strongly supported by the description of mouse models carrying mutations in two genes of the same or different signalling pathways.
For example, although Gas1−/− mutant mice exhibit partial fusion of the medial nasal processes and Shh+/− mice appear normal, Gas1−/−; Shh+/− mice embryos display complete fusion of the medial nasal processes (21), reminiscent of a HPE phenotype.
Such examples of animal models are numer- ous and all support the hypothesis that HPE could be because of a cumulative partial inhibition of signalling pathways implicated in forebrain development (6, 22) However, there are only a few examples in the litera- ture that suggest that HPE could be related to combined failures of several HPE genes in human (Table 2), includ- ing patients with co-occurring mutations or deletions in SHH/TGIF1 and SHH/ZIC2 (23).
Nevertheless, sequenc- ing of the four major genes (SHH, ZIC2, TGIF1 and SIX3) in large HPE cohorts has not allowed to validate this hypothesis (2, 5, 14).
Thus, the mode of inheritance of HPE is still unclear Identifying more genes in families in which poly- genic inheritance is suspected would be very benefi- cial to understand the pathogenic mechanism of this developmental disorder.
This is now facilitated by the recent development of next generation sequencing tech- nologies (19).
In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in a family where the father carries a mutation in SHH, transmitted to three foetuses with Table 1.

We hypothesized that the foetuses have all inherited a second mutation in another gene from the mother.
This original strategy was pow- erful as it revealed a second mutation in DISP1 shared by the mother and the HPE foetuses.
This family is the first one in which mutations in the two HPE-associated genes, SHH and DISP1, have been identified.
Further- more using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) method, the involvement of DISP1 in HPE was rein- forced by the observation of two DISP1 compound heterozygous mutations in another HPE family.
These results support the complexity of HPE inheritance and raise important questions about how clinicians should consider the inheritance mode of HPE Materials and methods Patients and samples Patients presenting midline abnormalities and suspicion of HPE were referred from the Centre Hospitalier Uni- versitaire of Rennes (France) and the Hôpital Cochin (Paris, France) through the network of reference centres for developmental anomalies and malformation syn- dromes (CLAD centres).
Patients and parents blood and tissue samples were obtained from the processing of biological samples through the Centre de Ressources Biologiques (CRB) Santé of Rennes BB-0033-00056 (http://www.crbsante-rennes.com).
The research pro- tocol was conducted under French legal guidelines and fulfilled the requirements of the local institutional ethics committee.
The parents of the photographed patient assented to include photographs in a scientific publication F1 family The mother II2 had three terminations of pregnancy with foetuses (III1, III2 and III3) harbouring semi-lobar or Complex mode of inheritance in holoprosencephaly alobar HPE (Fig.
1a and Table 3a).The F1 family also includes two other healthy girls III4 and III5, being 12- and 11-years-old, respectively.
The father II1, the grandfather I1 and the uncle II3 all present microcephaly This latter had four children among which three (III6, III7 and III9) harbour microcephaly and minor facial midline malformations (hypotelorism).
The father II1 also had two healthy siblings, II5 and II6 (Table 3a) DNA was available for all family members except II4 F2 family The F2 family includes three members, the two healthy parents I1 and I2 and their 9-year-old girl II1 who dis- played a lobar HPE (Fig.
2 and Table 3b).She has two healthy siblings but their DNA was not available.
Preg- nancy was normal.
A wide cleft palate was observed at birth, which was surgically treated.
II1 was then referred to genetic counselling at 5-and-half-years-old for psy- chomotor retardation (started walking at 21 months and had a language delay) and learning difficulties.
On clin- ical examination, she weighed 16.5 kg (−1 SD), was 109.5 cm tall, and had microcephaly (−2 SD).
She pre- sented facial dysmorphy with flat face, short nose, small mouth and hypotelorism (Fig.
2c,d).At the sight of these clinical observations, we recommended a molecu- lar diagnosis of HPE.
Molecular testing of 18 HPE genes was performed on the DNA of daughter II1, revealing the presence of two compound heterozygous mutations in the minor HPE gene DISP1.
Subsequently, to confirm the presence of HPE, MRI was performed and showed a mild form of lobar HPE with a very localized fusion of hemispheres in the forebrain (Fig.
2b) Whole exome sequencing WES was performed by the Genoscope on the DNA of the two parents, II1 and II2, and one of the foetuses III2 in F1 family, using ‘SeqCap EZ Exome v3.0’ capture (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on HiSeq™2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, California, United States).
Exomes were homogenously sequenced with a mean coverage of 93% of the targeted bases with read depth greater than 20X, and an overall mean depth of coverage of 112X.
Bioinformatic analyses were conducted with the Illumina pipeline analysis casava 1.8.
The sequenced reads were aligned on the reference human genome 19 (hg19) with Eland v2.0 before variant calling (SNV and INDEL) with the casava suite.
Resulting variants were annotated using annovar v2.0 (http://www.open bioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_filter.html).
Vari- ants population frequencies were extracted from three [the Exome Sequenc- different public databases ing Project (ESP6500), the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 g, 2014) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC02)].
Several bioinformatics predictions tools were used to predict conservation (gerp++, PhyloP, SiPhy, and PhastCons Elements 46-way) (24–27) and deleterious effect of SNVs and INDELs (sift, PolyPhen-2 hdiv and hvar, lrt, MutationTaster, 661 Mouden et al (a) (b) Fig.

Visual inspection of candidate variants was performed with Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States) Targeted high-throughput sequencing Targeted NGS was performed using Ion Torrent tech- nology (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, United States) on DNA from the girl II1 in F2 family.
Two pools of 711 primer pairs were designed (Ion Ampliseq technology, Life Technologies) to sequence all the exons of a panel of 18 genes involved in HPE or can- didates (SHH, ZIC2, TGIF1, SIX3, DISP1, CDON, GAS1, SUFU, FGF8, FGFR1, NODAL, HHAT, SUFU, TDGF1, PTCH1, FOXH1, SOX2 and DLL1) and 2 SHH expression regulatory regions, spanning 111 kb Libraries were sequenced with Ion PGM™ System (Life Technologies).
A PGM-specific pipeline incorporated in the Ion Torrent server (Torrent Suite version 4.0.2; Life Technologies) was used to perform the following steps: reads alignment on hg19, targeted regions coverage anal- ysis, filtering and removal of poor signal reads.
Variant calling was performed with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller version 4.0.
Mutations were annotated using annovar v2.0 as described for WES analysis and with alamut software (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) Sanger sequencing Sanger sequencing in F1 and F2 families assessed the intra-familial segregation of the candidate mutations found by NGS.
This was performed using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosys- tems, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) on an ABI3130xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and anal- ysed using SeqScape software v2.6 (Life Technologies) Functional validation of the SHH p.Pro347Gln mutation The human SHH cDNA (RefSeq NM_000193) was cloned in a pMSCVneo (Clontech, Mountain View, California, United States) vector.
