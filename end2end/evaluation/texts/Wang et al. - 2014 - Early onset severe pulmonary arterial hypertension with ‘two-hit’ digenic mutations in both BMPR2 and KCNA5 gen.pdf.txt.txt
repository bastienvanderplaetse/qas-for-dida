Various factors such as genetic mu- tations, inﬂammation/infection, drugs/toxins, abnormal metabolism, and altered hemodynamics have been reported in the molecular patho- genesis of PAH [2].
Among them, genetic predisposition caused by het- erogeneous germline mutations of the BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2, a member of the TGFβ signaling pathway) gene has been found to be accountable for 75% of heritable PAH (HPAH) and 25% idiopathic PAH (IPAH), respectively [3].
Other partners in the TGF-β signaling pathways, such as ACRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase type 1), ENG (endoglin), SMAD8, and SMAD4 genes, are also re- ported to be involved in the PAH pathogenesis [3].
The pore-forming subunit, Kv1.5, forms functional voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) and abnor- mal potassium channel Kv1.5 function encoded by KCNA5 mutations ☆ All authors take responsibility for all aspects of the reliability and freedom from bias of the data presented and their discussed interpretation.

Other genes such as CAV1, BMP9/GDF2 and KCNK3 have also been described in asso- ciation with both HPAH and IPAH [3] This present study is the ﬁrst to identify digenic mutations, a novel mutation in KCNA5 and a known mutation in BMPR2, supporting a ‘two-hit’ model for the severe disease course in an African-American girl with severe HPAH For clinical evaluation, the proband, a 13-year-old girl, and her mother were enrolled in the study after an informed written consent was obtained.
The patient and her mother were examined by echo Doppler (Philips IE33, 5/8 MHz transducer), cardiac computed tomogra- phy (CT, GE Lightspeed VCT 64 slice scanner) and 12 lead ECG The 13-year-old African-American girl presented for cardiology evaluation at six years of age following a syncopal episode that led to her diagnosis of PAH.
At 12 years of age, her catheterization revealed a mPAp of 69 mm Hg and a pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) of 26 mm Hg∗m2.
She was started on intravenous (IV) treprostinil which was gradually up-titrated to 165 ng/kg/min.
She had several blood stream infections and, eventually, was transitioned to subcutane- ous treprostinil at 13 years of age.
She subsequently underwent an aortopulmonary anastomosis (Potts shunt) due to clinical decline de- spite triple therapy (Fig.
1B–G).With the Potts shunt placement, tricus- pid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) increased from 1.55 cm (Fig.
1C) to 1.90 cm (Fig.1G), which suggests partially improved right ventricle function.
She is currently considering lung transplantation Her father had presented with PAH earlier the same year at the age of 25 and died within one year of complications of that disease.
The fam- ily history is otherwise negative (Fig.
1A).The mother has no signs or symptoms of PAH and has had a normal echocardiogram and exercise stress test For genetic evaluation, DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis were performed according to our protocols [5].
Genomic primer pairs (Supplemental Table 1) were designed to am- plify all of the coding regions and the intron–exon boundaries of known PAH-associated genes including BMPR2 [NM_001204.6], ACVRL1 [NM_ 001077401.1], ENG [NM_001114753.2], SMAD8 [NM_005905.5], SMAD4 [NM_005359.5], CAV1 [NM_001753.4], BMP9/GDF2 [NM_ 0016204.1], KCNK3 [NM_002246.2], and KCNA5 [NM_002234.3] By sequencing the 9 candidate genes, we identiﬁed digenic muta- tions in the index patient (Fig.

2.Genetic screening of the PAH-causing genes in the index patient.
Panel A shows the normal nucleotide fragment of BMPR2 with corresponding amino acids underneath.Panel B identiﬁes the heterozygous missense mutation at nucleotide position 1417 (c.1471CNT) in the exon 11 of the BMPR2 gene (NM_001204.6), which causes the amino acid changes from arginine to tryptophan at peptide position of 491 (p.R491W).
Panel C shows the normal nucleotide fragment of KCNA5 and its coded amino acids.Panel D illustrates the heterozygous deletion mutation at nucleotide position 1428 (c.1428delA) in the KCNA5 gene (NM_002234.3), which results in a frameshift mutation and leads to premature truncation in the C- terminal (p.Y483Sfs*4) of the potassium channel Kv1.5.
Black arrows in Panels B and D indicate the nucleotide change or deletion G.
Wang et al./ International Journal of Cardiology 177 (2014) e167–e169 e169 mutation (c.1471CNT) in exon 11 of the BMPR2 gene, causes change from arginine to tryptophan at amino acid position 491 (p.R491W) The other is a novel heterozygous deletion mutation at nucleotide posi- tion 1428 (c.1428delA) in the KCNA5 gene; it results in a frameshift mu- tation and premature truncation in the C-terminal (p.Y483Sfs*4) of the potassium channel Kv1.5.
Genetic screening of the mother revealed that she also has the novel deletion mutation in the KCNA5 gene.
The geno- type of the father is unknown, as his sample is unattainable Besides the two mutations, we also found a number of polymor- phisms (Supplemental Table 2) PAH is a progressive life-threatening disease with increased pulmo- nary artery pressure.
While BMPR2 mutations are found in the majority of affected patients with HPAH, it has been observed that heterozygous carriers of disease-causing BMPR2 mutations only have a 20% chance of developing PAH over their lifetimes [2].
One explanation of the low pen- etrance of BMPR2 mutations is that multiple “hits” may be required to cause disease onset and progression in carriers of BMPR2 mutations [6].
The ‘two-hit’ hypothesis of PAH proposes that in the presence of a predisposing genetic and/or molecular substrate, exposure to certain genetic, environmental or biological mediators of vascular injury initi- ates a cascade of adverse cell signaling events, culminating in gross structural malformation and functional deterioration to pulmonary ar- terioles [7].
In this case, the second hit may be a disease-modifying mu- tation in the KCNA5 gene rather than an environmental exposure The mutant BMPR2 R491W found in this case has previously been reported as a PAH-related gene mutation [8].
Y483 of Kv1.5 participates in the ion channel selectivity ﬁlter, and alteration or remodeling of this amino acid may severely impair channel function [9].
Moreover, Y483Sfs*4 results in a truncated Kv1.5 and loss of the C-terminal of S6 (S6T), which may further impair the channel gating by damaging the in- teraction between the S4–S5 linker and S6T [10] The ‘two-hit’ of the digenic mutations may account for the early oc- currence, severity and rapid deterioration of PAH in this patient.
The se- vere symptoms of PAH and rapid deterioration in her father may be due to BMPR2 R491W mutant.
However, the occurrence is at adult age, much later than the index patient in childhood.
