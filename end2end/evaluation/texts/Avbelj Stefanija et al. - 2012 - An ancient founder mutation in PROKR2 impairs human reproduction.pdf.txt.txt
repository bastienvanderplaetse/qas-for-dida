INTRODUCTION Mammalian reproduction is controlled at the neuroendocrine level by the tightly coordinated pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) from a small network of approxi- mately 1200 specialized hypothalamic neurons (1,2).
GnRH secretion stimulates the anterior pituitary to release gonadotro- pins, which, in turn, act on the gonads to regulate steroidogen- esis and gametogenesis.
Corresponding to the dominating role of this single hormone in the hypothalamic – pituitary – gonadal axis, the developmental ontogeny and homeostatic regulation of the GnRH neuronal network are highly complex and tightly linked to evolutionary ﬁtness.
Unique insights into the genetic networks and signaling pathways involved in GnRH neuronal ontogeny and hormonal action have been derived from the study of the human disease model of congenital iso- lated GnRH deﬁciency (3).
This genetic disease manifests as incomplete or absent sexual maturation and infertility, and it is clinically diagnosed as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypo- gonadism [IHH (MIM 146110)] with either normal sense of smell (normosmic IHH, nIHH) or anosmia [Kallmann syn- drome, KS (MIM 147950)] (4).
Although the current knowl- edge of GnRH biology is incomplete, that multiple developmental and neuroendocrine pathways are involved in the ontogeny and homeostasis of GnRH neurons, the secretion of GnRH and its action on the pituitary.
This complex regulation likely facilitates adaptation to diverse en- vironmental pressures on reproduction to ensure survival and evolution of the species is evident it The chemokine prokineticin 2 (PROK2) and its cognate G protein-coupled receptor (PROKR2) comprise one of the major signaling systems involved in GnRH ontogeny.
The mammalian prokineticin family has been implicated in diverse biologic processes, including neurogenesis, angiogen- esis, carcinogenesis, circadian rhythm regulation, inﬂamma- tion, immune system modulation and pain perception (5).
In the mouse brain, Prokr2 is the predominant prokineticin recep- tor, with high expression in the olfactory bulb and hypothal- amus (6 – 8).
During embryonic development, Prok2-Prokr2 signaling is essential for neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and for the migration of GnRH neurons from their develop- mental origin in the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus (8 – 10).
Prok22/2 and Prokr22/2 mice display hypoplastic olfactory bulbs, disrupted GnRH neuronal migration and hypoplastic reproductive organs due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (9,10).
Consistently, germline loss-of-function mutations in PROK2 (MIM 607002) and PROKR2 (MIM 607123) have been identiﬁed in patients with isolated GnRH deﬁciency (11 – 17) Without hormonal treatments to induce puberty and confer reproductive capacity, the large majority of IHH patients are infertile.
Therefore, the causative mutations must have been subjected to strong purifying (i.e.
negative) selection during evolution.
In accordance with this notion, almost every muta- tion that has been shown to underlie GnRH deﬁciency is rare among patients, and many mutations are even unique to spe- ciﬁc patients or families (17).
However, a few mutations occur in strikingly high percentages of GnRH-deﬁcient patients who harbor mutations in the respective gene, includ- ing GNRHR (MIM 138850) Q106R (44%), GNRHR R262Q (29%) (17 – 23) and TACR3 (MIM 162332) W275X (36%) (24 – 26).
In the prokineticin pathway, a commonly reported mutation PROKR2 L173R (40%) has emerged (11 – 13,15 – 17).
In addition to its implication in congenital isolated GnRH deﬁciency, the same mutation was also associated with hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) (27), a common repro- ductive disorder in females characterized by a reversible form of GnRH deﬁciency triggered by stressors The causal role of PROKR2 L173R in GnRH deﬁciency is strongly supported by the demonstration of dramatic reduction of the mutant receptor’s activity in cell-based functional assays (12,28).
Furthermore, homozygous patients phenocopy Prokr22/2 mice by presenting with severe KS (10,11,16) Notably, the PROKR2 L173R mutation has been identiﬁed in numerous patients with congenital GnRH deﬁciency from diverse geographic locations and ethnic backgrounds (11 – 13,15 – 17).
This could be either because the mutation has arisen de novo multiple times during human evolution (i.e.
it is a ‘hot spot’ mutation) or because it has been inherited from a common ancestor (i.e.
it is a ‘founder’ mutation) despite being associated with infertility.
To distinguish between these possibilities, this study tracked the genetic an- cestry of PROKR2 L173R; it also established the mutation’s frequency among large cohorts of patients with congenital GnRH deﬁciency and unaffected controls from various geo- graphic and ethnic populations, and determined the inheritance patterns of GnRH deﬁciency in mutation carriers.
Having documented that it is a founder mutation, its age was esti- mated; and lastly, a plausible explanation for the persistence of the mutation in the human gene pool is offered RESULTS PROKR2 L173R is a founder mutation of ancient origin The PROKR2 haplotype was evaluated in 23 probands (includ- ing 22 patients with GnRH deﬁciency and 1 proband with HA) carrying the PROKR2 L173R mutation and 33 available family members by genotyping 5 ﬂanking short tandem repeats (STRs) and 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
In 13 probands (11 heterozygotes and 2 homozy- gotes), the PROKR2 locus could be the haplotypes at 4316 Human Molecular Genetics, 2012, Vol.

Gray rectangle: region genotyped via SNP array analysis.Pink horizontal lines: haplotypes.
Blue horizontal lines: haplotype regions identical to each other.
In each of the homozygous probands (#2 and #12), the two haplotypes are labeled ‘a’ and ‘b’.The haplotype shared by all probands is marked with vertical dotted lines and is delimited by two major recombination hot spots on chromosome 20 (genomic region: NCBI build 36.1; recombination rates: HapMap, CEU population, public release #27) unambiguously (Supplementary Material, Table S1).
In all of these probands, PROKR2 L173R resided on the same core haplotype which has a size of (cid:4)123 kb determined (Fig.
1).In the remaining 10 probands, the haplotypes at the PROKR2 locus could not be unambiguously determined; nevertheless, the presence of PROKR2 L173R on the same haplotype was plausible (Supplementary Material, Table S1) This shared haplotype does not extend beyond major recom- bination hot spots ﬂanking PROKR2 and does not include ad- jacent genes, making their contribution to this disease highly unlikely.
According to HapMap Project data, the frequency of the shared haplotype is 6.7% in Europeans (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry), ,1% in Africans (Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria) and 2.2% in East Asians (Han Chinese from Beijing and Japanese from Tokyo) (29).
Thus, on the assumption that the frequency of the haplotype in the general population is not higher than 10%, the probability that PROKR2 L173R is a hot spot mutation that arose de novo 15 independent times (including 11 possibly independent events in 11 heterozygots and 4 in 2 homozygots) on the same haplo- type is ≤10215.
Therefore, PROKR2 L173R in all likelihood represents a founder mutation.
The small size of the shared haplotype and the evidence of multiple recombination events on each ﬂank (Fig.
1) indicate that the genotyped families are branches of a very ancient genealogy.
Based upon the size of the shared haplotype and the shape of the genetic tree, the age of the PROKR2 L173R mutation is estimated by an algo- rithm (30) to be approximately 300 generations (approximately 9000 years) with a 95% conﬁdence interval of approximately 150 – 400 generations.
Because nearly all branches of the genetic tree have distinct ends, a biased result from a putative re- combination hot spot can be ruled out, and the estimation of the mutation’s age is robust.
The mutation thus likely arose during the neolithic expansion of the human population that happened approximately 5500 – 12 000 years ago HA-associated PROKR2 L173R shares the same ancient haplotype The PROKR2 locus haplotype of the Caucasian proband (#6) with HA, a milder form of GnRH deﬁciency, and three of her ﬁrst-degree relatives were studied.
The mutation was found to reside on the same core haplotype as in the probands with con- genital GnRH deﬁciency (Fig.
1).The patient’s affected son with delayed puberty and her asymptomatic daughter had both inherited the disease haplotype (Fig.

The PROKR2 L173R mutation was identi- ﬁed in 2.4% [minor allele frequency (MAF) ¼ 1.3%] of unre- lated patients of diverse ethnic origins, including Caucasians, Brazilians, Mexicans and Maghrebis (inhabitants of a large region in North Africa stretching from Morocco to Libya) (Table 1).
Among the unaffected control the PROKR2 L173R mutation was identiﬁed only in two Cauca- sian females with otherwise normal puberty and proven fertil- ity (carrier rate ¼ 0.16%, MAF ¼ 0.08%).
On the other hand, subjects, PROKR2 L173R is one of the most commonly reported muta- tions associated with isolated GnRH deﬁciency.
In comparison, the most common GNRHR mutation, Q106R, was identiﬁed in 2.1% of patients (mainly of Caucasian and Brazilian origin) with MAF ¼ 1.2% (17,19 – 22,31,32), and the most common screened (MAF ¼ 1.4%), with all carriers being Turkish or TACR3 mutation, W275X, was identiﬁed in 2.0% of patients Kurdish (24 – 26) Complex inheritance of congenital GnRH deﬁciency in PROKR2 L173R mutation carriers Isolated GnRH deﬁciency is increasingly recognized as an oli- gogenic condition (16,17,33).
PROKR2 mutations have been implicated in diverse oligogenic interactions, including muta- tions in other genes regulating GnRH neuron ontogeny such as PROK2, KAL1 and FGFR1 (11,12,15 – 17,34).
The fact that L173R is the most common PROKR2 mutation facilitates the study of these concepts by reducing complexity due to allelic heterogeneity.
Complete penetrance of biallelic PROKR2 L173R mutations was demonstrated previously in two homozygotes and one compound heterozygote, all of whom had hyposmia or anosmia and severe GnRH deﬁciency as indicated by absent pubertal development, microphallus and/or cryptorchidism (11,16).
Whereas 15/19 probands with monoallelic PROKR2 L173R mutations also displayed severe GnRH deﬁciency, two had undergone partial puberty, and one had adult-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (35) that occurred after complete spontaneous pubertal devel- opment (Table 2); detailed clinical information on pubertal de- velopment was not available for the remaining proband.
Of the 19 probands carrying the heterozygous L173R mutation, all but four were hyposmic or anosmic.
Of the 18 ﬁrst-degree family members who harbored the L173R mutation, only four were affected, demonstrating highly variable penetrance of the heterozygous mutation as evident by their phenotypes: (i) KS [families 9 (11) and 11 (34)], (ii) delayed puberty (family 3) and (iii) borderline sense of smell—5th percentile (family 11) (Fig.
2).In family 3 (Fig.
3), the proband and an unaffected sibling carrying the heterozygous PROKR2 L173R had identical PROKR2 haplotypes on both paternal and maternal alleles, excluding the possibility that penetrance is determined by additional (non-coding) inherited mutations Table 2.
