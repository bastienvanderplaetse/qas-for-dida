Abstract Purpose/aim of the study: To date, different genes have been identified as responsible for the presence of normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH).
Herein, we report the molecular findings regarding the analysis of PROK2, in two brothers with nCHH Subjects and methods: Two siblings with nCHH, in whom mutations in GNRHR, PROKR2 and FGFR1 had been investigated previously, as well as their family were studied.
DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced for the PROK2 gene.
Controls were analyzed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism.
The structure of PROK2 and its mutant protein were compared using a protein molecular model.
Results: Both affected siblings exhibited a heterozygous p.R117W mutation in PROK2, while their mother was a heterozygous carrier and their father, an unaffected brother and their sister were homozygous wild type.
Besides, both patients presented a homozygous p.E90K mutation in GNRHR that had been previously reported Conclusions: We found a novel mutation in PROK2 in two siblings in whom a mutation in the GNRHR gene had been previously reported Keywords GNRHR, molecular modeling, nCHH, PROK2, triallelic digenic mutations History Received 26 February 2014 Revised 1 October 2014 Accepted 21 October 2014 Published online 19 December 2014 Introduction Individuals with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) (MIM 146110) are characterized by a complete or a partial failure to achieve spontaneous pubertal development, due to defect in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) release and/ or action (1).
In these cases, the biological hallmark is the presence of decreased levels of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone, associated with low levels of gonadal steroids.
When these patients exhibit a normal sense of smell, the pathological entity is termed as normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH) (1,2) *Present address: Unidad de InvestigacioÂ´n en Obesidad: Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional AutoÂ´noma de MeÂ´xico.

Although KS and nCHH were thought to be two distinct entities, there have been pedigrees described with both KS and nCHH individuals (1,4,5).
It has been documented that nCHH can be transmitted as an autosomal dominant or as an autosomal recessive trait; albeit sporadic forms have been described (5â€“8) The gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) (MIM 138850) was the first gene found to cause autosomal recessive nCHH (9,10).
Several GNRHR mutations have been identified in many patients, a majority of which has been compounded heterozygotes (7).
Indeed, GNRHR mutations explained less than 50% of familial nCHH cases and a small fraction of sporadic cases.
Based on the latter, it was suggested that nCHH was a heterogeneous condition caused by various genetic defects (11).
Thus far, at least 11 different genes have been identified to yield nCHH: the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) (KAL2, MIM 136350), the Kisspeptin receptor (MIM 604161), Kisspeptin (KISS1) (12) (MIM 603286), the prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2) (13) (KAL3, MIM607123), as well as encoding GPR54 (KISS1R) Endocr Res Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Universitaet Zuerich on 01/03/15For personal use only.2 J.
P.MeÂ´ndez et al Endocr Res, Early Online: 1â€“6 its ligand prokineticin 2 (PROK2) (5) (KAL4, MIM 607002), the chromadomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD7) (14) (KAL5, MIM 608892), the fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) (15) (KAL6, MIM 600483), the nasal embryonic LHRH factor (NELF) (MIM 608137) (16), the neurokinin B (TAC3, MIM 162330), and its receptor (TACR3, MIM 162332) (17), and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1) (MIM 152760) It has been demonstrated that PROK2 and its receptor (PROKR2) are involved in diverse biological processes including reproduction, as well as bulb morphogenesis (18,19); besides, mutations in this gene have been associated with nCHH (5,13,20,21) Mutations in the identified genetic loci account for about 30% of CHH cases, indicating that there are other unknown genes involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder (22).
In addition, nCHH is marked by a clinical heterogeneity in terms of the reproductive phenotype, even in subjects carrying identical mutations (23).
Besides, it has been established that up to 12.5% of nCHH cases carry mutations in more than one gene (24).
To gather into the complex molecular basis of CHH, we performed the molecular analysis of PROK2 in two siblings with nCHH in whom mutations in GNRHR, PROKR2 and FGFR1 had been previously sought.
Our results, expand the spectrum of niche-associated molecular defects, associated with triallelic GNRHR/PROK2 mutations further insight Subjects and methods Subjects The study was approved by the Instituteâ€™s Human Research Committees; both patients gave their informed written consent.
A transversal descriptive study was performed Two brothers with diagnosis of nCHH; as well as the father, mother, another brother and one sister of both siblings, were included.
Sequences of the open reading frame of GNRHR, PROKR2, and FGFR1 had been studied previously.
Neither patient presented mutations in FGFR1 and PROKR2; how- ever, they exhibited a mutation in GNRHR (6).
All family members were of Mexican-Mestizo ethnic origin, from the central part of Mexico Both patients came to our outpatient clinic at 21 (patient A) and 19 (patient B) years of age, due to the absence of pubertal development.
They had a normal sense of smell after performing the test described by Rosen et al.
(25) and did not exhibit non-reproductive anomalies such as mirror move- ments, renal anomalies, cleft palate, sensorineural deafness, or dental agenesis; however, they presented bilateral crypt- orchidism, surgically repaired at 4 (patient A) and 3 (patient B) years of age.
Computed axial the hypothalamicâ€“pituitary region did not demonstrate any anomaly of the olfactory bulbs.
Testicular volumes were 3.6 ml (right) and 2.5 ml (left) (Patient A), and 1.5ml and 1.8ml (Patient B); both presented microphallus (stretched penile length52.5 cm) (26) tomography of Baseline plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by specific double-antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were measured by a liquid phase RIA (27) All hormones were determined at the age of diagnosis (21 and 19 years).
In both siblings hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was documented, basal testosterone (0.52 and 0.38 nmol/L) and gonadotropin concentrations (LH53.0 IU/L and FSH, 50.5 IU/L) were in the prepubertal range.
Growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid hormones and cortisol were within normal values Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes by standard techniques (28).
DNA was amplified by PCR in 25 ml of reaction mixture containing 100â€“200 ng of genomic DNA, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 2.0 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymer- ase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation, Brazil), and 250 nM of each specific set of PROK2 primers.
The sequence of the primers, the sizes of the amplified products and PCR conditions have been described previously (29).
After amp- lification, PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide to verify the correct size of the expected fragments PCR products from the PROK2 gene were purified by QIAEX II (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).
DNA sequences (100 ng DNA template/reaction) were determined by cycle sequencing, on an automated DNA sequencer ABI 377 (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) using the DNA Sequencing Kit BigDyeÃ” Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Sequencing was performed following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer.
For exon 4 of PROK2, both DNA strands were sequenced and compared; besides, each mutation was confirmed in three independent PCR amplifi- cations and sequencing In order to evaluate if the nucleotide change in exon 4 of PROK2 was not present in the general population, we per- formed a restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 200 fertile subjects.
Briefly, the 324 bps PCR product was digested with Hpy166II (New England, Biolabs, Inc.
Beverly, MA) restriction enzyme at 37 C for 16 h and electrophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel.
In the case of a C nucleotide (wild type), at position 12442, Hpy166II digestion produced two major products: 161 and 144 bp fragments, whereas the 305 bp fragment remained when the T nucleotide (mutant variant) was located at this position (data not shown) Computational assessment of the PROK2 mutation PolyPhen-2, a sequence homology-based program (http:// genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), was used to predict the functional impact of the novel mutation (p.R117W) found in this study.
This software predicts how damaging a particular variant may be by using a set of empirical rules based on sequence, as well as phylogenetic and structural information characterizing a particular variant Theoretical analysis of human p.R117W PROK2 mutation to analyze the possible effect of the punctual In order the mutation of human PROK2 detected and to infer consequences on protein folding and function, a homology molecular modeling of the proteins was performed.

The protein templates used for modeling were the prokineticin Bv8 (PDB code: 2kra) (33) and the mamba intestinal toxin (PDB code: 1mti), which showed 96% and 78% of query coverage, respectively, (http:// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Eight models were generated for each protein, which were evaluated using assessment tools that were previously reported (34), and the models were selected by means of their Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), TM-score, C-score (35); as well as by the conformation analysis with Ramachandran plots.
For analyz- ing possible folding changes on our selected models a refinement process in vaccuo, during 10 000 steps at 0 K by using the and the CHARMM27 parameters implemented in the Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD 2.6; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL) program, was performed (36).
These refined models were structurally analyzed in the same form as described above and compared with their respective unrefined forms steepest descendent protocol Results After sequencing all exons of the PROK2 gene, both siblings exhibited a heterozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 349 (c.349C4T) in exon 4, which results in an arginine- to-tryptophan substitution at codon 117 (p.R117W) (Figure 1: II-1, II-2, respectively).
Their mother was a heterozygous carrier (Figure 1: I-2), while the father (Figure 1: I-1), and the unaffected siblings (brother and sister), were wild type homozygous (Figure 1: II-3, II-4,).
Two hundred (400 alleles) individuals, classified as Tanner 5 and with proven fertility were used as controls; none of these subjects harbored the mutation According to the results from the Polyphen analysis, it was shown that the novel PROK2 p.R117W substitution gave a PSIC score difference of 2.192, indicating that this change is probably damaging.
On the other hand, PROK2 models with the highest score were those obtained when the prokineticin Bv8 was used as template (Figure 2A).
Unsurprisingly, the obtained models showed high tridimensional (3D) similarity with the used templates (Figure 2A) and the conformational changes after Indeed, the RMSD between common regions of models and tem- plates, or between unrefined and refined models were lower than 2.13AËš  refinement process were modest Figure 1.

Superposition of (A) wild-type PROK2 (in white) and template (prokineticin Bv8; PDB code: 2KRA; in black) models and (B) Wild type (in white) and mutated (in black) forms of the PROK2 protein On all 3D refined models for PROK2, the coils were predominant; further, we observed nine segments with lamina beta conformation, and only one alpha segment.
The p.
R117W mutation located near the carboxyl terminus, posterior to the eighth beta strand, did not modify folding or conformation in this position; in contrast, a minor conform- ational change was noticed in the coil between the eighth and ninth beta strands (Figure 2B) Discussion In the present study, we have analyzed the PROK2 gene in two siblings with nCHH in whom mutations in GNRHR, PROKR2 and FGFR1 had been previously sought.
A novel heterozygous mutation in exon 4 of PROK2 was found in both male siblings; the mother was a heterozygous carrier of one mutant allele.
Interestingly, these same patients had been reported previously, due to the fact they harbored a homo- zygous mutation in GNRHR (6).
Functional analysis showed that this mutant protein impairs receptor function, inducing a misfolding with abnormal the mutant protein (37,38) trafficking of In regard to our results, the heterozygous mutation was located in exon 4 of PROK2 (c.349C>T, p.R117W); interestingly, to date, there are few reported mutations in this gene associated with KS or nCHH: three in exon 1, six in exon 2 and four in exon 4.
One of them is a frameshift with a premature stop codon (c.297_298insT; p.G100fsX22) and three are missense change (c.301C4T; p.R101W, c.302G4A; p.R101Q, and c.310C4T; p.H104Y) (13,20,21,39).
Our the fifth mutation described in mutation p.R117W is exon 4, it leads to a non-conservative amino-acid substitution, changing a highly conserved residue.
This mutation is located near the carboxyl terminus, posterior to the eighth beta strand In the absence of functional testing, one cannot ascertain that the p.
R117W mutation found in both siblings, is the cause of the disease.
However, this mutation was not identified in 400 alleles studied by us, nor this change has been previously reported, making the possibility of a polymorphism unlikely Moreover, in silico analysis showed that the novel PROK2 p.R117W substitution has a PSIC score difference of 2.192, supporting the possibility that it is a deleterious mutation since a PSIC score difference of 1.5 and above, is considered to be damaging (40).
In addition, albeit only slight changes were found in the mutated protein by homology molecular modeling, these modifications may be essential in receptor recognition To date, there are few reports of possible digenic inheritance in patients with nCHH (15,22,24,41,42).
DodeÂ´ et al (29), described the first digenic mutation in one heterozygous patient for a PROKR2 mutation that was also carrying a missense mutation in KAL1, thus indicating a possible digenic inheritance of the disease in that individual Quaynor et al (24), studied the prevalence of digenic mutations in patients with nCHH and KS, analyzing 13 genes involved in the genesis of these diseases observing that eight patients with nCHH presented digenic mutations However, digenic o trigenic mutations involving the PROK2 gene in patients with nCHH have not been described Taking into consideration previous results regarding other genes, in some cases these entities appear to follow the pattern of other disorders that were initially thought to be monogenic, but have been proven to be attributed to more than one gene defect (22).
It has been proposed that PROK2 may participate in a multiprotein complex that becomes progressively compromised by additional mutations in genes that play a role in the integrity of the GNRH neuronal system (5,22) Notably, Pitteloud et al.
(22) described one family with two sisters presenting nCHH, harboring a heterozygous FGFR1 mutation (p.R470L), in whom a compound hetero- the GNRHR gene (p.Q106R and zygous mutation of p.R262Q) had been described previously (43), therefore demonstrating a triallelic pattern of inheritance.
The add- itional FGFR1 mutation could explain the variable pheno- typic expressivity observed between pedigrees harboring the same compound heterozygous GNRHR mutation, since the father had a history of delayed puberty and was heterozygous for p.R262Q in GNRHR (also heterozygous for p.R470L in FGFR1); the mother without any reproductive disorder was heterozygous only for p.Q106R in GNRHR, while their brother and niece were homozygous for the wild type of both Endocr Res Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Universitaet Zuerich on 01/03/15For personal use only.Digenic mutations in patients with nCHH 5 DOI: 10.3109/07435800.2014.982327 Figure 3.
Pedigree of the family with nCHH with GNRHR and PROK2 mutations.
The mother (I-2) was a carrier for the p.E90K and the p.R117W of GNRHR and PROK2, respectively.
Both patients (II-1 and II-2) presented both mutated alleles of GNRHR (p.E90K) and one mutated allele of PROK2 (p.R117W/wt); whereas, the father (I-1), and the brother (II-3) were unaffected carriers only for the p.E90K/wt of GNRHR while exhibiting wild type (wt) alleles for PROK2 The unaffected sister (II-4) presented the wild type for both genes genes (22,42).
Similarly, the presence of the heterozygous mutation in PROK2 may explain the phenotypic expression variability observed in our family (Figure 3).
Both patients exhibited complete nCHH with total absence of puberty.
The mother of both patients was a heterozygous carrier for mutations in GNRHR and PROK2.
She did not show any abnormalities regarding pubertal development, menstrual cycles, sense of smell or serum gonadotropin and estradiol concentrations The discovery of concomitant mutations in more than one nCHH-related gene, in some patients with this disorder, does not prove that each mutation has a causative role in the existing phenotype.
In fact, in the majority of cases a single mutation in one of the involved genes is enough to cause nCHH (24) In conclusion, we found a novel mutation in PROK2 in two male siblings presenting nCHH, in whom a mutation in the GNRHR gene had been previously described, suggesting the possibility of a digenic inheritance.
Likewise, our data extend previous reports demonstrating that PROK2 plays a role in the etiology of this syndrome; therefore, mutations in PROK2 should be considered the possible cause of disease in GNRH deficient subjects with or without anosmia.
Finally, as suggested by DodeÂ´ and Rondard (21), further studies will be necessary to analyze whether mutations in PROK2 affect the process of binding and/or activation of PROKR2 by the hormone Declaration of interest All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
