explanation of the purpose.The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch and the Ethical Committee of Okayama Prefectural University Synthesis of cDNAs Total RNA was prepared from a buffy coat fraction from c 15 ml heparinised peripheral blood, according to the method of Chirgwin et al (1979).
The ﬁrst strand DNA was synthesised ) using SuperScript RNaseH reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), primed with oligo(dT)12)18, and then used for ampliﬁcation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
PCR ampliﬁcation of the sequence encoding the mature portion of the CPO protein (reference sequence in gene bank NM_000097) was performed by using a set of oligomers, 5¢-CCACCGCCGCCTTCGGGCAT bound begin- ning at nucleotide 41 of the CPO sequence NM_000097, and 5¢-CCCCTGCACAGCCATTCTGCCT bound the comple- mentary strand beginning at nucleotide 2317 (Martasek et al, 1994; Taketani et al, 1994).
The entire coding region of ALAD cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR, as described previously (Akagi et al, 1999).
Ampliﬁcations were performed at least twice in separate experiments.
PCR was carried out using a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer-Cetus Corp., Norwalk, CT, USA), employing a thermal cycle programme, as described previously (Ishida et al, 1990) Cloning and sequencing of cDNAs Polymerase chain reaction products were puriﬁed using QIAEX (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany), followed by cloning into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to transform JM109 cells (Promega).
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain-termination method using Table I.
