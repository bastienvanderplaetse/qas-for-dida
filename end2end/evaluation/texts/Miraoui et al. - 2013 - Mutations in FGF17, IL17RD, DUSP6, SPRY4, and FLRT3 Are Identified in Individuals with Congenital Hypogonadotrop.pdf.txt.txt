Introduction Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH [MIM 146110]) due to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deﬁciency and/or resistance is a rare genetic disorder char- acterized by abnormal pubertal development and infer- tility.1 CHH is often associated with anosmia and is then termed Kallmann syndrome (KS [MIM 308700, 147950, 244200, 610628, 612370, and 612702]), as well as with other phenotypes including unilateral renal agenesis, skel- etal abnormalities, midline malformations, and hearing loss.2 A number of genes are associated with congenital GnRH deﬁciency.3 Nevertheless, <40% of individuals have been shown to harbor mutations in one or more of the >15 known genes.
