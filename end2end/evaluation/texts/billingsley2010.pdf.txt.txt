ABSTRACT Background BardeteBiedl syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder with 14 BBS genes identiﬁed.
BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9 form a complex called the BBSome, which is believed to recruit Rab8GTP to the primary cilium and promote ciliogenesis.
The second group, the chaperonin-like proteins BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12, have been deﬁned as a vertebrate-speciﬁc branch of the type II chaperonin superfamily.
These may play a role in the regulation of BBSome assembly Methods and results Using sequence analysis, the role of BBS6, 10 and 12 was assessed in the patient population comprising 93 cases from 74 families Systemic and ocular phenotypes were deﬁned.
In the study, chaperonin-like BBS gene mutations accounted for the disease in approximately 36.5% of BBS families.
A total of 38 different non-polymorphic exonic sequence variants were identiﬁed in 40.5% of BBS families (41.9% cases), of which 26 were novel (68%).
Six cases had mutations present in more than one chaperonin-like BBS gene.
One case with four mutations in BBS10 had a phenotype of overall greater severity.
The phenotypes observed were beyond the classic BBS phenotype as they overlapped with characteristics of MKKS (congenital heart defect, vaginal atresia, hydrometrocolpos, cryptorchidism), as well as Alstro¨m syndrome (diabetes, hearing loss, liver abnormalities, endocrine anomalies, cardiomyopathy) Conclusions While overlap between the MKKS and BBS phenotypes has previously been reported for cases with BBS6 mutations, we also observed MKKS phenotypes involving BBS10 and BBS12 and Alstro¨m-like phenotypes associated with mutations in BBS1, BBS2, BBS6, BBS7, BBS9, BBS10 and BBS12 for the ﬁrst time INTRODUCTION BardeteBiedl syndrome (BBS; MIM 209900) is a genetically heterogeneous, pleiotropic ciliopathy disorder characterised by retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, hypo- gonadism, and cognitive impairment.
The 14 BBS genes identiﬁed (BBS1 to BBS14) account for approximately 70% of affected families.1 2 The new knowledge that BBS proteins are important for biogenesis and maintenance of the cilium explains the pleiotropy of this condition.3 4 Genetic and clinical phenotype overlaps with other ciliopathies, such as McKusick Kaufman syndrome (MKKS, BBS6; MIM604896), Alström syndrome (ALMS, MIM203800) and Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS; MIM 249000, 603294, 607361, 611134), have been described.1 5e9 These allelic variants can lead to very different clinical entities For example, mutations in the MKKS (BBS6) gene result in a MKKS phenotype (hydrometrocolpos, cardiac malformation), a BBS phenotype or a combination of both Most of the BBS proteins can be broken into two groups.
BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9 form a complex called the BBSome which is believed to recruit Rab8GTP to enter the primary cilium and promote ciliogenesis.4 The second group, the chaperonin-like proteins including BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12, are a part of rapidly evolving, vertebrate speciﬁc branch of the type II chaperonin superfamily.2 BBS6 was shown to shuttle rapidly between the centrosome and the cytosol,10 and to be important for cytokinesis,11 while the BBS10 and BBS12 proteins, seen within the basal body of the primary cilium of differentiating preadipocytes, are important for ciliogenesis and adipogenesis.12 As the function of these chaperonin-like proteins is being elucidated, these are proposed to play a role in the regulation of BBSome assembly.13 As part of a larger scale project of mutational analysis of BBS genes, we present here the role of type II chaperonin-like BBS genes in our patients of diverse ancestral background.
Mutations in BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12 were disease causing in 36.5% of BBS families and the overlapping phenotypes of MKKS and Alström were seen in several of these patients SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patient recruitment The Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board approved this study, which respected the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The patient cohort of 74 families (93 cases) was of multiethnic origin and recruited from The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and from collaborators abroad (Spain, USA, South Africa).
Diagnosis of BBS was based on the presentation of four of the six primary features including retinitis pigmentosa, poly- dactyly, obesity, cognitive impairment, genital abnormalities and/or renal failure, or three primary plus two secondary features.14 J Med Genet 2010;47:453e463.

Systemic evaluation documented body index (BMI), physical developmental abnormalities, mass assessment of impairment/developmental delay, genital abnormalities, lipid proﬁle, and liver and kidney function tests.
Ocular phenotypes were deﬁned using a comprehensive ocular exam, kinetic perimetry, full ﬁeld electroretinography (ERG), and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) cognitive chain atoms in the BBS proteins were assigned the spatial coordinates of equivalent residues in the 1q2v template.
The conformations of the side chains were built onto the BBS model backbone using a Metropolis Monte Carlo procedure imple- mented in the software Modzinger (Ogata, Leplea, Wodak, unpublished).
Despite the very low sequence homology between the BBS proteins and the available templates, these models were guides for missense mutations that could be mapped onto the three conserved domains.
Modelling the effects of these muta- tions was done by searching for optimal side chain positions within the core of the constructed BBS structures regions intronic of BBS6 and ﬂanking Innovation Centre Mutational analysis Genomic DNA was isolated using standard protocols.
Coding exons (RefSeq NM_018848), BBS10 (RefSeq NM _024685.3) and BBS12 (RefSeq NM_152618.2) were PCR ampliﬁed from 50 ng of genomic DNA in Dr Héon’s laboratory.
Samples were directly sequenced by The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG, Toronto, Ontario, USA) or by the McGill University and Génome Québec (Montreal, Quebec, Canada).
Sequence changes observed were conﬁrmed on both sense and antisense DNA strands.
Primers and conditions are available upon request.
Segregation analysis of observed variants was performed when possible.
The allele frequency of novel mutations was assessed in at least 300 control chromosomes (from the Héon Lab, Coriell Caucasian Human Variation PaneldTCAG, HapMap Yoruba/YRIdPaterson Lab and Cree, Ojibway, InuitdHegele Lab) using either ampliﬁcation refrac- tory mutation system (ARMS) assays, restriction enzyme digests, or heteroduplex analysis.
Speciﬁc ethnic backgrounds were evaluated when available.
Novel mutations were evaluated for predicted potential effects on splicing, destruction or creation of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), and interspecies conserva- tion using a variety of publicly available software.
PolyPhen analysis was used to predict whether missense mutations could impact the protein structure and function.
Protein modelling is discussed below.
Web resources used are listed at the end of the article and in supplementary table 1 Potential pathogenicity was based on positive family segre- gation, an allele frequency of <1/300 chromosomes, and bioin- formatic prediction of biological signiﬁcance.
Changes discussed are non-polymorphic (allele frequency <1%).
Some changes discussed are of unclear pathogenicity Protein modelling To gain insight into the effects of the missense mutations identiﬁed, models of BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12 were built using homology modelling techniques.
These three proteins closely resemble the group II chaperonin a subunit, sharing the same three domain structures: equatorial, intermediate, and apical The protein sequences were extracted from the RefSeq resource of NCBI (accession number NP_061336, NP_078961.3, NP_689831.2).
A search using pfam and blast with default options identiﬁed three structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)15: a group II chaperonin structure (PDB RCSB code 1q2v), Cpn60 (1we3) and Thermosome (1a6d).
All three had low sequence identity (15e23%) to the BBS6/10/12 proteins.
The group II chaperonin protein (1q2v) was the closest related (21% to BBS6; 17% to BBS10; 16% to BBS12), and was used as the main template.
The BBS protein sequences were aligned to the template protein using NW alignment16 and gaps in the sequences corresponding to a-helices and b-strands were manually displaced towards positions in loop regions.
The main RESULTS Mutational analysis Thirty-eight non-polymorphic sequence variants were identiﬁed Twenty-six (68%) were novel and summarised in table 1 and ﬁgure 1.
Two ‘presumed pathogenic’ alleles in BBS6, BBS10 or BBS12 were seen in 27/74 (36.5%) families.
BBS10 carried the largest mutational load (21.6%, 16/74 families) Thirty-six per cent of cases (12/33) with a ‘chaperonin-like’ BBS mutation also had additional mutated alleles in at least one other BBS gene.
In 50% this ‘extra mutant allele’ involved a ‘chaperonin-like’ BBS gene Mutations were distributed throughout the three coding sequences studied and affected a wide range of ethnic back- grounds.
Recurrent mutations (supplementary table 2) were mostly of European ancestry except for one (BBS10: K243IfsX15), which was seen here only in black individuals of South African origin.
Patients carrying BBS12 mutations were of non-European ancestry.
Details of the mutated nucleotides including bioinfor- matics analysis are provided in supplementary table 1 BBS6 mutations Four of the six different BBS6 mutations identiﬁed were novel (table 1).
Three of these (G41R, C99R, and P299L) affected highly conserved residues, were predicted to destroy potential ESE sites, and were predicted to be ‘probably damaging’ by PolyPhen (supplementary table 1).
The mutation of case 46 (F94SfsX9) was previously published7 but phenotype data are presented for the ﬁrst time.
The phenotypes of cases 11 and 46 show an overlap with the ALMS phenotype and an MKKS phenotype (table 2) Heterozygous BBS6 changes were seen in three unrelated patients (cases 30, 80 and 38, table 1) for whom the ‘principal mutation’ also involved a chaperonin-like BBS gene.
The epistatic effect of BBS6 A242S17 18 in case 80 (vs sib case 79) could not be assessed.
The BBS6 A488T (case 38) variant was associated with mutations in BBS9 and BBS12 in a child with a mixed BBS/MKKS phenotype having hydrometrocolpos and congenital heart disease BBS10 mutations Ten of the 18 different BBS10 mutations identiﬁed were novel Nineteen cases (16 families) had homozygous or compound heterozygous BBS10 changes (table 1) Affected sibs of South African descent (cases 65 and 66) carried the novel L55P and E274VfsX29 mutations that segre- gated with the disease phenotype (ﬁgure 2a).
The variant E274VfsX29, if translated, would be missing 62% of the native protein (ﬁgure 1) with the addition of 28 novel amino acids These sibs also carried BBS12 mutations (discussed below).
