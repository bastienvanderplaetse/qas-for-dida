The purpose of the present study was to determine whether IHH/ KS is caused by NELF mutations solely or in combination with mutations in other known genes MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients IHH was diagnosed in male patients R18 years with absent puberty, testos- terone levels <100 ng/dL (normal 300–1,100 ng/dL), and low or normal serum gonadotropins.
In female patients, IHH was deﬁned as primary amen- orrhea at R17 years with low E2 (<30 pg/mL) and low or normal gonadotro- pins (4, 5).
All patients had normal TSH, thyroxin, cortisol, and prolactin.No pituitary tumor was present by radiographic imaging.
Complete IHH/KS was deﬁned as the absence of puberty without thelarche (Tanner 1) in female patients and testes %3 mL in male patients.
Incomplete IHH/KS was deﬁned as partial breast development in female patients and testes R4 mL in male patients (4).
Anosmia was deﬁned by using the University of Penn- sylvania Smell Test, when available, or by history.
Lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated as a source for DNA, RNA, and/or protein (4).
Each of the patients signed an informed consent approved by the Human Assurance Committee of the Medical College of Georgia Genomic Analysis Genomic DNA from 168 unrelated IHH/KS patients was ampliﬁed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using NELF primers ﬂanking the 15 exons/ splice junctions (Supplemental Table 1, available online at www.fertstert org).
DNA sequencing was performed as described previously (14).Putative mutations were conﬁrmed and sequenced in R180 healthy control subjects Four NELF nucleotide variants identiﬁed in three IHH/KS patients were screened in 372 ethnically matched control subjects.
In the patient with biallelic NELF mutations, PCR products were cloned by using the TA- Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to determine if they were on the same allele (16).
To exclude digenic disease in patients with NELF muta- tions, the protein-coding regions and splice junctions were sequenced for 11 other known IHH/KS genes: CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, TACR3, KAL1, GNRHR, GNRH1, and KISS1R (primers available on request) Splice Mutant Detection Intronic mutations were analyzed by using ESE Finder version 3 (http:// rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/tools/ESE3/eseﬁnder.cgi) to determine any effect on predicted SR protein–binding sites involved in splicing (26).
Sequence was the Berkley Drosophila Genome Project site (http:// also analyzed at 0 and 3 www.fruitﬂy.org/seq_tools/splice) to predict possible effects on 5 splicing consensus sequences.
Reverse-transcription (RT) PCR was used to determine if the mutations affected splicing.
Total RNA was extracted 0 from lymphoblastoid cells by using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and subjected to Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR with Plat- inumTaq (Invitrogen) using gene-speciﬁc primers with appropriate negative and positive control samples.
PCR products were electrophoresed, puriﬁed, cloned by using the TA-Cloning Kit, and sequenced Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR Lymphoblast RNAwas used for RT-quantitative PCR RT-(qPCR) with Super- script II Platinum Sybr Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit (27).
A standard curve 0 was constructed with known amounts of human NELF cDNA (primers 5 - 0 0 -TGCGGGCTTCCTAATGCT-3 ) AACGGCGCAGATCACCTG-3 0 and for PPIA, encoding cycolphilin-A (primers 5 -CCTAAAGCA- 0 ).
NELF TACGGGTCCTG-3 RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate, normalized to PPIA, and analyzed using the CT method with a mixed-model analysis of variance 0 -GCCATCCAACCACTCAGTCT-3 0 and 5 0 and 5 Protein Expression and Protein Modeling Western blots were performed on lymphoblast protein by using standard methods (28) with our polyclonal NELF antibody (27) and a b-actin antibody to control for loading differences.
NELF/b-actin band intensity was quanti- tated by densitometry (27).
Protein modeling was done as detailed in the Sup- plemental Methods (available online) RESULTS Three of 168 (1.8%) IHH/KS patients demonstrated NELF muta- tions: two men with KS and one man with nIHH.
These included: one heterozygous missense mutation (c.757G>A; p.Ala253Thr), one heterozygous splice mutation (c.1160–13C>T), and compound heterozygous intronic mutations (c.629–21G>C; c.629–23C>G), which were not present in the National Center for Biotechnology In- formation (NCBI) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database or 372 control subjects (Table 1; Fig.
1A).Additionally, 11 novel polymorphisms were identiﬁed (Supplemental Table 2, available online at www.fertstert.org) The functional signiﬁcance of four speciﬁc nucleotide changes was investigated for in vitro evidence of impaired function.
The ﬁrst patient, nIHH male C54, had compound heterozygous NELF muta- tions (c.629–21G>C/c.629–23C>G) as determined by sequencing cloned PCR products (Table 1; Fig.
1A).Analysis of lymphoblast NELF protein consistently demonstrated a 50% reduction com- pared with control (Fig.
2).ESE-Finder analysis predicts that c.629–21G>C will create new SF2/ASF and SC35 binding sites for SR proteins and the c.629–23C>G will create a new SF2/ASF binding site.
However, no reduced mRNA expression or altered splicing was observed in lymphoblasts (data not shown).
This patient had no other associated anomalies or affected family members.
Im- portantly, he had no coexistent mutations in CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, TACR3, KAL1, GNRHR, GNRH1, or KISS1R The second patient (KS male C7) had a heterozygous c.757G>A (p.Ala253Thr) mutation (Fig.
1; Table 1) affecting a completely con- served Ala253 residue (Supplemental Figs.
1–4, available online at www.fertstert.org).
By using multiple alignment (Expresso) (29), a protein model for the N-terminus was constructed (30).
Both SPPIDER [I checked this–it is not SSPIDER as I thought] (31) and Interprosurf analysis (Supplemental Fig.
4) suggested func- tional importance for Ala253, and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) (32) predicted a deleterious effect for p.Ala253Thr.
Although p.Ala253Thr did not alter splicing or quantitative mRNA expression (data not shown), lymphoblast protein expression was consistently reduced by 50% in vitro (Fig.
2) sequence This p.Ala253Thr mutation was identiﬁed in a male with sporadic KS, unilateral renal agenesis, and partial pubertal development.

1B) that we characterized previously (17).This in-frame dele- tion removes a fully conserved cysteine residue in the anosmin-1 protein encoded by KAL1 (Supplemental Figs.
1C and 1D).The KS proband with NELF/KAL1 mutations had no mutations in CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, TACR3, GNRHR, GNRH1, or KISS1R The third NELF mutation analyzed in vitro was a heterozygous c.1160–13C>T in intron 10 identiﬁed in male KS patient C68 (Fig.
1A; Table 1).He had completely absent puberty, bilateral cryptorchidism, no other anomalies, and no other affected family members.
This mutation was predicted to alter the location of an SF2/ASF binding site and result in the loss of an SRp40 binding site, both of which could disrupt normal splicing (26).
The weak splice acceptor site score of 0.52 predicts that this 3 splice site may be susceptible to alternative splicing events; in fact, exon 10 skipping was demonstrated by RT-PCR and subcloning (Fig.
3) The mutation introduces two aberrant out-of-frame amino acids (AAs), causing a frameshift and a premature termination codon at residue 378 located 9 bp downstream of the junction between exons 9 and 11.
The resulting NELF protein is predicted to be truncated by >28% of the C-terminus.
The altered transcript was seen in 4/30 clones from patient C68, but not in 100 clones obtained by RT- PCR from three unrelated control subjects.
The intronic mutation 0 FIGURE 3 did not quantitatively affect mRNA or protein expression (data not shown).
However, this genomic c.1160–13C>T variant was not seen in the NCBI SNP database or in 372 ethnically-matched control subjects, arguing against a polymorphism This patient also was found to have a novel heterozygous TACR3 nonsense mutation p.Trp275X not seen in 180 control subjects (Fig.
1C; Table 1).Trp275 lies within a cytoplasmic domain between the ﬁfth and sixth transmembrane domains of this G-protein– coupled receptor (33), thereby predicting the loss of 191AA from codons 275–465 and truncating 40% of the C-terminus (Fig.
1C).He had no mutations in CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, KAL1, GNRHR, GNRH1, or KISS1R.
Un- fortunately, in all three probands with NELF mutations, no other family members were available for de novo or segregation analysis DISCUSSION Our ﬁndings indicate that NELF is likely to be causative in IHH/KS Previously, Miura et al (24) demonstrated a heterozygous c.1438A>G (p.Thr480Ala) NELF variant in 1/65 IHH patients based to c.1432A>G;p.Thr478Ala from NP_056352).
Because Thr478 was only partially conserved (Supplemental Fig.
1B) and no in vitro analysis was performed, its functional signiﬁcance is unknown AY_255128 sequence on (now revised NELF splice mutant.
Subcloning and sequencing analysis of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction products of NELF exons 8–12 from patient and control lymphoblastoid RNA conﬁrms that the human NELF c.1160–13C>T mutation causes aberrant exon 10 skipping Splicing patterns are compared between a normal control and the mutant by cloned cDNA sequencing (the wild-type or mutant band is a cloned fragment).
An expected NELF product of 280 bp including exons 9 and 10 is observed in the control (lane 2), whereas an abnormal product of 246 bp skipping exon 10 (34 bp) is observed in a KS patient with c.1160–13C>T (lane 3).
Exon 11 nucleotides and out-of-frame novel amino acid sequence are depicted in blue.

NELF mutations in IHH/Kallmann syndrome.Fertil Steril 2011 Fertility and Sterilityâ 1617 (24).
No other IHH/KS genes were studied, so digenic disease can- not be excluded One heterozygous NELF splice mutation (c.1159–14_22del) has been described (9).
However, the only KS individual within the family also had a heterozygous FGFR1 mutation (p.Leu342Ser), suggesting digenic disease (9).
This NELF deletion was associated with exon 10 skipping, but it was not sufﬁcient to cause KS alone (9).
Thus, no human NELF mutations, supported in vitro, and without mutations in a second gene, have been reported to cause IHH/KS In the present study, 3/168 (1.8%) of IHH/KS patients had NELF mutations demonstrating impaired function in vitro, which is similar to GNRHR (14) and greater than KISS1R mutations (34) in nIHH patients.
To exclude digenic disease, sequencing of 11 additional genes (CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, TACR3, KAL1, GNRHR, GNRH1, and KISS1R) was performed Compound heterozygous NELF mutations in an nIHH male patient quantitatively reduced protein expression by 50% , but unexpect- edly it did not reduce mRNA expression.
mRNA/protein discordance can occur by ‘‘leaky’’ expression of splice variants (35), altered expression of proteins with multiple isoforms (36), altered protein translation rate (37), and post-translational modiﬁcations (38); and it has been seen in microarray/proteomics comparisons (39, 40) The exact mechanism by which the present mRNA/protein discordance occurs is unknown.
Because these intronic sequence variants introduce two additional SR protein binding sites important in constitutive splicing, their perturbation could affect alternative splicing in a tissue- and developmentally speciﬁc fashion (26).
Alternatively, human NELF and its rat ortholog (24, 27, 41) have multiple isoforms, which could contribute.
We hypothesize that biallelic NELF mutations are necessary for the phenotypic manifestation of IHH.
Our nIHH male patient had no additional mutation in 11 known IHH/KS genes studied.
We think that these are the ﬁrst reported biallelic NELF mutations Two additional heterozygous NELF mutations occurred in unre- lated KS patients in a digenic pattern.
In a KS male patient, hetero- zygous NELF/hemizygous KAL1 mutations were identiﬁed that were not observed in 372 ethnically matched control subjects.
The p.Ala253Thr NELF missense mutation resulted in a drastic AA substitution from a hydrophobic to hydrophilic residue.
Multiple in silico methods also suggest that this mutation is likely to be deleterious.
These include complete conservation of Ala253 (Supplemental Figs.
1–4), SIFT analysis, and protein modeling Furthermore, protein expression was markedly reduced in vitro, providing additional support for a deleterious effect.
This patient with the p.Ala253Thr NELF missense mutation also had a hemizygous KAL1 deletion of the completely conserved Cys163 within the whey-acidic-protein (WAP) domain that forms a disulﬁde bridge with Cys134 of anosmin-1 (Supplemental Figs.
1C and 1D) (42).
Unilateral renal agenesis in this patient is likely related to this deleterious KAL1 mutation (43) The third KS male patient was heterozygous for both NELF and TACR3 nonsense mutations.
The NELF mutation disrupted splicing, deleting exon 10, and is predicted to cause protein truncation Although observed in a subset of clones, this splice mutant was not seen in 100 control clones; and the mutation was not observed in 372 ethnically matched control subjects.
The low frequency of this altered transcript suggests potential mRNA instability, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this splice variant could be a rare sequence variant The combination of heterozygous NELF/TACR3 mutations pro- vides intriguing observations regarding KS patients with digenic disease (33).
To date, homozygous TACR3 mutations have been identiﬁed only in nIHH.
p.Trp275X is not only the ﬁrst nonsense TACR3 mutation reported, it is also the ﬁrst heterozygous TACR3 mutation identiﬁed in KS in a digenic pattern with NELF p.Trp275X is predicted to abolish the sixth–seventh transmembrane domains with truncation of the C-terminus of the neurokinin B receptor-3 encoded by TACR3 (Fig.
1C) (33).Disruption of G-protein transmembrane domains commonly impairs signal transduction in nIHH/KS genes GNRHR (3), KISS1R (34), TACR3 (33), and PROKR2 (44) Perhaps the combination of a heterozygous TACR3 nonsense mu- tation with a heterozygous NELF truncation mutation could cause a more severe phenotype, such as the present KS patient with com- pletely absent puberty and bilateral cryptorchidism (Table 1).
It is interesting that the present NELF splice mutant and the one reported previously (9) resulted in exon 10 skipping, but neither alone was sufﬁcient to cause KS, which required a mutation in a second gene Two unrelated KS patients in the present study demonstrated previously unreported patterns of NELF/KAL1 and NELF/TACR3 mutations.
We hypothesize that mutations in two loci exacerbate phenotype expressivity by synergistic heterozygosity.
Synergistic heterozygosity refers to phenotypic expression caused by several partial protein defects in more than one pathway (45), which is quite conceivable for known IHH/KS genes KAL1 and TACR3.
Synergis- tic heterozygosity has been described in metabolic disorders (45, 46) and primary pulmonary hypertension (47).
In addition to KS (8–10), mutations in more than one gene have been reported in other diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, epidermolysis bullosa, and deafness (48–50) Overall, NELF lacks homology with any known protein sequence except for AA209–528 used for protein modeling, and it has no N-terminal signal peptide (24).
We have demonstrated intranuclear expression in immortalized GnRH neurons and identiﬁed a func- tional nuclear localization signal and putative zinc ﬁngers, suggest- ing that it could be a transcription factor (27).
It is tempting to speculate that NELF might bind the KAL1 and/or TACR3 promoters, but this has yet to be determined experimentally.
However, NELF is involved in GnRH neuron migration in mouse (22, 27), zebraﬁsh (51), and human, as determined in the present study by the demon- stration of mutations in KS Human NELF has been localized to chromosome 9q34.3, where a deletion syndrome has been described in two male patients with abnormal genitalia and in an anosmic female patient (52).
The dele- tion encompasses NELF, thereby implicating NELF in the partial KS phenotypes of these individuals.
Based upon our ﬁndings and the NELF deletion within 9q34.3, we propose that NELF loss- of-function might be a potential mechanism for IHH/KS In summary, three novel human NELF mutations were identiﬁed in IHH/KS for a prevalence of 2%.
We describe the ﬁrst compound heterozygous NELF mutation reported in an nIHH male patient without mutations in 11 known IHH/KS genes.
In addition, a previ- ously unreported association of NELF/KAL1 and NELF/TACR3 was identiﬁed in KS.
Our ﬁndings suggest that mutation of one NELF allele may not be sufﬁcient to result in disease unless there is an additional mutant NELF allele or coexistent mutation in another gene.
These ﬁndings, along with several earlier reports of NELF/ FGFR (9) and PROKR2/KAL (8, 10), highlight the importance of biallelic mutations in IHH/KS and warrant future consideration Acknowledgments: The authors thank all of the affected individuals and their families for their participation.

95, No.5, April 2011 SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS An initial template selection was performed by using 3D-Jury(1), Phyre(2), and Fugue(3) servers, which failed to ﬁnd high-homology templates for the whole protein.
Because of the importance of having a model on the region of the mutation Ala253Thr, we focused our work on the region from 209 to 528, using as a template 2R10 (PDB code structure of an acetylated Rsc4 tandem bromodomain histone chimera) and predicted by 3D-Jury.
We used Expresso to generate an alignment between NELF and 2R10, which is a multiple se- quence alignment method that aligns sequences using structural information We used MOE to generate a model on the basis of the alignment, which has low conﬁdence for the C-terminal region of the sequence modeled, but high conﬁdence (Supplemental Fig.
