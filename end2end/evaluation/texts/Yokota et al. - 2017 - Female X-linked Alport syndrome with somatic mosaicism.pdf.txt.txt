Abstract Background X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is a pro- gressive, hereditary nephropathy.
Although males with XLAS usually develop end-stage renal disease before 30 years of age, some men show a milder phenotype and possess somatic mosaic variants of the type IV collagen a5 gene (COL4A5), with severity depending on variant fre- quencies.
In females, somatic mosaic variants are rarely reported in XLAS, and it is not clear what determines severity Methods Two females with somatic mosaic mutations in COL4A5 with variant frequencies of 17.9 and 22.1% were detected using the next-generation sequencing.
One patient only had hematuria.
The other, however, had moderate proteinuria, which is a severe phenotype for a female XLAS patient of her age.
The molecular mechanisms for the severe phenotype were investigated by examining variant frequencies in urinary sediment cells and X chro- mosome inactivation patterns, and by looking for modiﬁer variants in podocyte-related genes using the next-genera- tion sequencing & Kandai Nozu nozu@med.kobe-u.ac.jp 1 Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo, Kobe 6500017, Japan 2 Department of Pediatrics, Komatsu Municipal Hospital, Komatsu, Ishikawa, Japan 3 Department of Nephrology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children’s Medical Center, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan 4 Department of Pediatrics, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan Results The severe phenotype patient had a variant fre- quency of 36.6% in urinary sediment cells, which is not markedly high, nor did she show skewed X chromosome inactivation.
However, she did have the heterozygous variant in COL4A3, which can affect severity Conclusion Factors determining severity in female XLAS patients remain unclear.
One studied patient with the somatic variant in COL4A5 showed a severe phenotype without skewed X chromosome inactivation, which might be derived from digenic variants in COL4A3 and COL4A5 Further studies are required to determine molecular mechanisms behind female XLAS resulting in the severe phenotype Keywords Somatic mosaic variants  Female  Next-generation sequencing  X chromosome inactivation  Modiﬁer gene Introduction Alport syndrome is a hereditary disorder of type IV col- lagen, characterized by chronic kidney disease progressing to end-stage renal disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities.
Approximately 80% of Alport syn- drome patients (XLAS) (OMIM301050) and variants in COL4A5, which encodes the type IV collagen a5 chain.
COL4A5 variants result in abnormal type IV collagen a5 expression, typically with the complete absence of type IV collagen a5 in the glomerular basement membrane and Bowman’s capsule in men, and a mosaic expression pattern in women [1] show X-linked inheritance Male patients with XLAS usually develop end-stage renal disease by the age of 30 [2].
We recently reported that some male cases tend to show a milder phenotype, because 123 878 Clin Exp Nephrol (2017) 21:877–883 they possess somatic mosaic variants in COL4A5 [3, 4] We previously examined four male cases with somatic mosaic variants using the next-generation sequencing and determined allele frequency.
Interestingly, the two patients whose variant frequency was greater than 50% showed hematuria and moderate proteinuria; however, the two patients whose frequency was than 50% were asymptomatic or only had hematuria.
This suggests that the low variant frequency results in a milder phenotype in male cases of XLAS with somatic mosaic variants [4] less The molecular mechanisms affecting severity in female cases are unclear.
This study discusses two female cases of XLAS with somatic mosaic variants in COL4A5, one in which showed a severe phenotype.
In the severe phenotype case, we examined variant frequency, X chromosome inactivation pattern, and inﬂuence of modiﬁer genes Materials and methods Targeted resequencing isolated using a Quick-DNA urine kit Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leuko- cytes from the patients and their family members using the Quick Gene Mini 80 system (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufac- turer’s instructions.
Genomic DNA from urinary sediment was (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA).
The next-generation sequencing samples were prepared using a HaloPlex target enrichment system kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions Brieﬂy, digested genomic DNA (225 ng) was hybridized at 54 °C for 16 h with custom-designed next-generation sequencing probes to capture 45 genes, including COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5, and other segmental glomerulosclerosis causative genes to search for modiﬁer genes [5].
Ampliﬁed target libraries were sequenced with 150-base pair-end reads using the MiSeq platform (Illu- mina, San Diego, CA, USA), followed by variant analysis using SureCall 3.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) focal Mutational analyses using Sanger sequencing For genomic DNA analysis, exon 30 and exon 32 of COL4A5 were ampliﬁed by PCR.
PCR-ampliﬁed products were puriﬁed and subjected to direct sequencing using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Bio- sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3130; Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
For variant descrip- tions, sequences were NC_000023.9 and reference 123 NM_000495.3.
Exons were numbered according to a pre- vious report [6] PCR-based X chromosome inactivation analysis for To assess X chromosome inactivation patterns in the affected females, a PCR-based HUMARA assay (i.e., digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucle- ase Hpa II the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) followed by PCR ampliﬁcation and fragment analysis) was performed.
Brieﬂy, HpaII digestion results in the cleavage of the non-methylated HUMARA template DNA.
As HUMARA contains variable numbers of CAG repeats between different alleles, PCR results in two peaks, corresponding to the maternal and paternal X chromo- somes, which can be identiﬁed and quantiﬁed.
This method was established by Allen et al.
[7].They calculated the activity ratio on the basis of Southern blotting, reading the density of bands for the maternal and paternal alleles.
This method was modiﬁed by Kubota et al.
with the use of GeneScan (ABI Prism 3130; Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to improve the quan- tiﬁcation of the PCR product [8].
Genomic DNA (200 ng) was digested at 37 °C for 16 h using 5 units of the restric- tion enzyme Dde I with or without 25 units of Hpa II (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) in a total volume of 20 lL followed by heat-inactivation at 80 °C for 20 min Dde I is a restriction enzyme of which recognition sites are randomly distributed over genomic DNA.
It cuts DNA into small pieces, resulting in improved efﬁciency in digestion by Hpa II and the following PCR ampliﬁcation.
The PCR reaction mixture contained 1 lL of digested products, 10 lL of HotStarTaq plus Master Mix (29) (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), and 0.5 lL each of 10 lM primers (FAM-labeled forward primer: 50-TCCAGAATCTGT TCCAGAGCGTGC-30; and reverse primer: 50-GCT GTGAAGGTTGCTGTTCCTCAT-30) in a total volume of 20 lL.
PCR was performed as follows: ﬁrst denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for 5 min Ampliﬁed products were run on an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), and the fragments were analyzed using GeneMap- per software (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) Ò Ò Skewed X chromosome inactivation was evaluated by calculating a corrected ratio compensating for ampliﬁca- tion bias of the shorter allele.
The corrected ratio was obtained by dividing the peak height of the shorter allele over the longer allele of the double-digested sample by the peak height of the shorter allele over the longer allele of the single-digested sample.
Results showing a corrected ratio of 80:20–100:0 were determined as having a skewed X chromosomal inactivation pattern Clin Exp Nephrol (2017) 21:877–883 Ethical considerations All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Insti- tutional Review Board of Kobe University School of Medicine.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents Results (Table 1) Case presentations Case 1 was an adult woman.
Her family tree is shown in Fig.
1a.Her son was diagnosed with Alport syndrome by kidney biopsy.
She had had hematuria from 10 years old, but had not displayed proteinuria until recently.
It was determined that her son had a missense mutation of c.2405G[T (p.Gly802Val) at exon 30 of COL4A5 by tar- geted sequencing using the next-generation sequencing; the variant has been reported as pathogenic [9].
We conducted Sanger sequencing for Case 1 to conﬁrm that she had the same variant with heterozygosity; however, the chro- matogram showed a very small T peak, suggesting that she had the variant with a somatic mosaic state (Fig.
2a; con- ﬁrmed using Sanger sequencing).
Therefore, we conducted the next-generation sequencing and determined a variant frequency of 17.9% with a read depth of 190 Case 2 was an 11-year-old girl.
Her family tree is shown in Fig.
1b.No family member had urinary abnormalities She had had hematuria and proteinuria from the age of 1 Her urinary protein/creatinine was 1.0 g/gCr, although she was taking angiotensin receptor blockers.
Kidney biopsy revealed a thin basement membrane.
Her kidney function 879 was within the normal range.
Case 2 had a kidney biopsy conducted at 11 years of age, which revealed a basket weave change in the GBM.
Based on our clinical experi- ence, the presence of this histological phenotype, as well as moderate proteinuria, indicates that the case should be diagnosed as severe, although there is no widely accepted index for determining severity in female XLAS cases The next-generation sequencing revealed c.2732G[A (p.Gly911Glu) at exon 32 of COL4A5 (Fig.
2b; conﬁrmed using Sanger sequencing of all family members).
The variant allele frequency was 22.1% with the read depth of 149 From genetic analyses, it was determined that Case 1 had a very mild phenotype of XLAS, which is consistent with female cases which have a somatic mosaic variant in COL4A5; however, Case 2 had an unexpectedly severe phenotype on the same genetic background.
Therefore, further studies were conducted for Case 2 to uncover the molecular background of the severe phenotype Comparison of variant frequencies between kidney biopsies and urinary sediment We previously reported that urinary sediment could be used as an alternative cell source to kidney biopsies [10, 11].
In this study, we compared allele frequencies between DNA extracted from two sources of leukocytes and urinary sediment for Case 2 and found 22.1% in leukocytes with a read depth of 149 and 36.6% in urinary sediment with a read depth of 216.
Urine sediment showed the higher percentage for the variant but was much less than 50%, meaning that she should have shown the milder phenotype when compared with typical heterozygous female XLAS patients (50%) Table 1 Clinical and genetic characteristics of the two cases with somatic mosaic variants Case Case 1: adult female Case 2: 11-year-old girl Kidney symptoms Hematuria Hematuria Pathological ﬁndings COL4A5 gene variant Exon Nucleotide change Amino acid change Variant frequency (%) Leukocytes Urinary sediment Not conducted 30 c.2405G[T p.Gly802Val 17.9 Not conducted X chromosome inactivation (maternal:paternal) Leukocytes Urinary sediment Not conducted Modiﬁer gene variant Not detected Moderate Proteinuria Thin basement membrane 32 c.2732G[A p.Gly911Glu 22.1 36.6 42:58 34:66 COL4A3 Exon 42 c.3691G[A (p.Gly1231Ser) 123 Clin Exp Nephrol (2017) 21:877–883 880 Fig.

3) Case 2 was a sporadic case, and it is not known which allele the variant derived from.
The result, however, did not show the skewed X inactivation pattern and, therefore, did not inﬂuence severity For the search of modiﬁer genes, ideally whole exome sequencing should be conducted.
However, because only podocyte-related genes have been identiﬁed previously as modiﬁers of this disease, we selected 45 podocyte-related genes, as shown in Table 2 [5, 12, 13] In targeted sequence analysis for 45 podocyte-related genes, we detected c.3691G[A (p.Gly1231Ser) in COL4A3.

Left panels show PCR assay results without digestion.
Right panels show results after digestion.The activity ratios of maternal and paternal alleles were 42:58 in leukocytes and 34:66 in urinary sediment.
This result did not show the skewed X inactivation pattern and did not inﬂuence severity.
The father’s results show no peak after digestion, meaning that digestion was complete, because, generally, the male X chromosome has 100% activity which will result in complete disappearance of the peak after digestion novel variant.
The father and sister of Case 2 possessed the same variant, but both did not have urinary abnormalities (Fig.
2c; conﬁrmed using Sanger sequencing of all family members).
Predicting software revealed that the amino acid substitution affecting protein function was probably dam- aging (polymorphism phenotyping v2) and damaging (sorting intolerant from tolerant) Discussion The next-generation sequencing analysis has seen a rapid increase in use in many areas of genetic research.
Low frequencies of mosaic variants are very difﬁcult to detect using Sanger sequencing.
The next-generation sequenc- ing is far more sensitive for these kinds of variants [4, 14] We previously reported four male XLAS patients with somatic COL4A5 variants who showed milder phenotypes than normal male XLAS patients [4].
Interestingly, patients with low variant allele frequencies show a milder pheno- type.
Frequency differs in different organs, and, in severe cases, variant frequency can be high in kidney cells.
A recent study by Beicht et al.
described a female XLAS patient with a somatic mosaic variant who had variant allele frequencies of 14, 7, 4, and 7% in leukocytes, urinary sediment, hair roots, and oral mucosa, respectively, deter- mined using the next-generation sequencing [14] Female cases of XLAS can show variety in severity even among members of the same family [15].
Factors that affect severity in females are not clear.
Some studies have reported that skewed X chromosome inactivation may determine the clinical phenotype [16, 17]; however, no large-scale studies have been performed.

Another study reported that digenic variants in both COL4A5 and MYO1E resulted in the most severe symptoms and the development of end- stage renal disease in a girl aged 8 and in a boy aged 3 [12] These studies suggest the existence of modiﬁer genes that can result in the more severe phenotypes in female patients with XLAS.
Currently, no common mechanism for the development of severe XLAS in females has been deter- mined.
No genotype–phenotype correlation has been demonstrated [15].
The contributions of skewed X chro- mosome inactivation or modiﬁer genes have been reported based on a small number of cases [12, 13, 17].
This sug- gests that the underlying mechanism may be heterogeneous for each individual.
Another possibility is the inﬂuence of disease- or kidney function-related susceptibility genes that can be determined by genome-wide association [18].
Fur- ther investigation, including a genome-wide association study (GWAS), should be conducted for female XLAS cases.
As a result, we detected a COL4A5 variant with somatic mosaic and a COL4A3 missense variant.
Together, they result in a severe phenotype in Case 2 123 In this study, we describe two female XLAS patients with mosaic variants in COL4A5.
Case 1 showed a very mild phenotype of hematuria without proteinuria.
Case 2, an 11-year-old girl, showed a severe phenotype of mod- erate proteinuria, although she had a mosaic variant with a frequency of 22.1% in leukocytes For the two COL4A5 variants, p.Gly802Val and p.Gly911Glu, that were detected in this study, the ﬁrst is a novel variant, although a different amino acid substitution at the same position (p.Gly802Arg) has been reported, and the second variant has been reported previously [9, 19] Generally, missense variants result in milder phenotypes than nonsense mutations.
In addition, these two cases exhibited variants expressed in a mosaic manner.
There- fore, they would be predicted to show mild phenotypes.
As expected, Case 1 showed a very mild phenotype of only hematuria; however, Case 2 exhibited a severe phenotype The difference of the severity in these two cases prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the devel- opment of a severe phenotype in female XLAS cases To investigate the molecular mechanisms in Case 2 resulting in the severe phenotype, we examined three factors: (1) differences in variant frequency between leucocytes and urinary sediment; (2) the X chromosome inactivation pattern; and (3) possible modiﬁer gene variants.
These studies revealed no contribution by variant frequency or X chromo- some inactivation, but we did identify a COL4A3 pathogenic variant that may have had an effect on the phenotype Although the variant c.3691G[A in COL4A3 is novel and the father and the sister, who possessed the same variant, did not show urinary abnormalities, predicting software recognized this variant as pathogenic.
It is, therefore, suggested that this variant affected severity in this particular case The next-generation sequencing is an important tool for the diagnosis of Alport syndrome [5].
This study suggests the use of the next-generation sequencing for detecting mosaic variants even in female cases, including detection of variant frequency, which helps estimate clinical severity It should be noted that in females, other factors can inﬂu- ence severity, such as a skewed X chromosome inactiva- tion pattern or the existence of modiﬁer genes [12, 13] However, in most cases, the mechanism for developing a severe phenotype is still unclear.
Therefore, a search for additional disease- or kidney function-related susceptibility genes using GWAS should be conducted Conclusion The next-generation sequencing was used to identify two female cases of XLAS with somatic mosaic variants in COL4A5.
Phenotype severity in females could be affected by modiﬁer gene variants Clin Exp Nephrol (2017) 21:877–883 883 Acknowledgements This study was supported by a Grant from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan for Research on Rare Intractable Diseases in Kidney and Urinary Tract (H24-nanchitou (nan)-ippan-041 to Kazumoto Iijima) in the ‘‘Research on Measures for Intractable Diseases’’ Project; a Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research (KAKENHI) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Subject ID: 25893131 to Kandai Nozu and 26293203 to Kazumoto Iijima) Compliance with ethical standards Conﬂict of interest Kandai Nozu received lecture fees from Novartis Pharma K.K.
