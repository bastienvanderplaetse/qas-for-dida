Abstract Background:Dental agenesis is the most common, often heritable, developmental anomaly in humans.
Although WNT10A gene mutations are known to cause rare syndromes associated with tooth agenesis, including onycho-odontodermal dysplasia (OODD), Scho¨ pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome (SSPS), hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), and more than half of the cases of isolated oligodontia recently, the genotype-phenotype correlations and the mode of inheritance of WNT10A mutations remain unclear.
The phenotypic expression with WNT10A mutations shows a high degree of variability, suggesting that other genes might function with WNT10A in regulating ectodermal organ development.
Moreover, the involvement of mutations in other genes, such as EDA, which is also associated with HED and isolated tooth agenesis, is not clear.
Therefore, we hypothesized that EDA mutations interact with WNT10A mutations to play a role in tooth agenesis Additionally, EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD encode signaling molecules in the Eda/Edar/NF-kB signaling pathways, we also checked EDAR and EDARADD in this study Methods:WNT10A, EDA, EDAR and EDARADD were sequenced in 88 patients with isolated oligodontia and 26 patients with syndromic tooth agenesis.
The structure of two mutated WNT10A and two mutated EDA proteins was analyzed Results:Digenic mutations of both WNT10A and EDA were identified in 2 of 88 (2.27%) isolated oligodontia cases and 4 of 26 (15.38%) syndromic tooth agenesis cases.
No mutation in EDAR or EDARADD gene was found Conclusions:WNT10A and EDA digenic mutations could result in oligodontia and syndromic tooth agenesis in the Chinese population.
Moreover, our results will greatly expand the genotypic spectrum of tooth agenesis Citation: He H, Han D, Feng H, Qu H, Song S, et al.

Permanent tooth agenesis can occur as an isolated anomaly (non-syndromic) or as a part of multiple congenital anomalies (syndromic) [2–4], such as anhidrotic or hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), onycho-odontodermal dysplasia (OODD) and Scho¨pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome (SSPS).
Selective tooth agenesis is divided into 2 types: hypodontia, the agenesis of fewer than six teeth, and oligodontia, the agenesis of six or more permanent teeth Mutations of the WNT10A gene are responsible for OODD, HED and SSPS [5–7].
OODD, a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, teeth, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma, hypotrichosis and various is characterized mainly by abnormal other associated ectodermal abnormalities, including neoplasms [5].
HED is characterized by a triad of signs comprising sparse hair (hypotrichosis), abnormal or missing teeth (anodontia or hypodontia), and inability to sweat (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis) [6] SSPS is distinguished by the presence of multiple eyelid cysts, histologically corresponding to apocrine hidrocystomas [7] WNT10A, a 46.4-kDa protein with 10 putative a-helices and seven putative b-strands, belongs to Wnt proteins, a large family of secreted signaling proteins.
Wnt10a is expressed in embryonic limb [8], skin [9], teeth [10,11], and hair follicles [12,13] during embryonic development; it plays an important role in odontoblast differentiation and tooth morphogenesis [11].
Recently, WNT10A mutations were identified in more than half of isolated hypodontia the phenotypic expression of WNT10A cases [14].
However, mutations shows a high degree of variability, ranging from only isolated hypodontia to various symptoms of ectodermal dysplasia PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80393 Moreover, the genotype-phenotype correlations and the mode of inheritance of WNT10A mutations remain unclear [6,14,15] Therefore, other genetic factors or unidentified mutations may also influence phenotypic expression in patients with WNT10A mutations [6,14] EDA is an important gene associated with tooth agenesis, it is located on chromosome Xq12–q13.1 and encodes for ectodyspla- sin-A (EDA) (MIM 300451), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family [16].
EDA is a type II transmembrane protein with a C-terminal TNF homology domain and a signaling molecule [17].
EDAR and EDARADD encode the protein EDAR and EDARADD, belonging to the Eda/Edar/NF-kB signaling pathway.
The binding of Eda-Edar (complex formed by EDA and its to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB and is essential for the development of hair follicles, teeth, exocrine glands and other ectodermal derivatives [17–19].
EDA gene mutations have been detected in 63–95% of X-Linked HED (XLHED) patients [16,20– 23].
Moreover, EDA mutations are also associated with cases of isolated tooth agenesis [24,25].
We therefore hypothesized that EDA mutations may interact with WNT10A mutations and play a role in the development of tooth agenesis to the downstream adaptor Edaradd leads receptor) In this study, we investigated the contribution of WNT10A, EDA, EDAR and EDARADD mutations in patients with isolated or syndromic tooth agenesis.
Our results suggest that WNT10A and EDA digenic mutations could result in tooth agenesis.
This is the first time such mutations have been reported in patients with tooth agenesis Materials and Methods Participants Written informed consent for DNA analysis and reproduction of the photographs was obtained from all the participants and the parents on the behalf of the minors or children participants.
This study was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Peking University Health Science Center The study participants were 88 non-consanguineous patients with isolated tooth agenesis, 26 non-consanguineous patients with syndromic tooth agenesis (24 with HED and 2 with OODD), and 451 non-consanguineous normal controls, who were referred to the Department of Prosthodontics, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, or the Department of Prothodontics, Beijing Stomatological Hospital.
Oral examinations for all participants were performed by a prosthodontist, who determined the status of the dentition.
A panoramic radiograph was taken to confirm the diagnosis of tooth agenesis for these participants.
The shape and size of the residual teeth were also observed The patients with isolated dental agenesis reported normal sweating and lachrymal secretions.
They had no complaints about dry mouth, intolerance to heat, or susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.
The patients had hair on their body and scalp, and their facial features, skin, and nails were normal on observation Patients with HED presented abnormalities of at least two of the three following ectodermal structures: teeth, hair and sweat glands The OODD patients had abnormal teeth, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma and other associated ectodermal abnormalities DNA extraction Genomic DNA of the participants and their relatives was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using a QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen).
DNA samples of the normal WNT10A and EDA Digenic Mutations in Tooth Agenesis participants recruited from the general population were extracted from buccal epithelial cells using the Chelex-100 (Sigma) method Detection of mutations Screening of the WNT10A, EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD genes was performed by direct sequencing of five PCR fragments for WNT10A, eight PCR fragments for EDA, ten PCR fragments for EDAR, and eight PCR fragments for EDARADD, which cover the entire cDNA including exons and intron-exon junctions of more than 100 base pairs.
We compared all primer sequences to the whole-genome assembly in the ENSEMBL database to verify their uniqueness against gene families.
Primer sequences are available upon request Protein structure analysis We performed protein structure analysis on the two WNT10A mutations (p.R171C and p.G213S) and two novel EDA mutations (p.G257R and p.I312M) that were identified in this study For WNT10A, the conservation of residues in sequences was determined to predict the influence of the two mutations.
The sequences of orthologs of human WNT10A protein were retrieved from the KEGG database [26]; these sequences were used to perform sequence alignment with ClustalX2.0.12 [27].
PsiPred 3.0 [28] was used to predict the 2D structure of human WNT10A protein We used the crystal structure of EDA-A1 (PDB id 1RJ7 [29]) as a scaffold to predict the influence of the mutations.
The structures were analyzed using the Insight II (2000) software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Images were produced by PyMOL (DeLano WL., 2002.The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA.
http://www pymol.org) from PDB file 1RJ7 Results Digenic mutations of both EDA and WNT10A were identified in 2 of 88 (2.27%) isolated oligodontia cases and 4 of 26 (15.38%) syndromic tooth agenesis cases.
The patients in all four syndromic cases had HED (Fig.
1).No mutation in EDAR or EDARADD gene was found, however, some single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were detected (Table S1) Clinical details and DNA sequence analysis of six nuclear families with digenic mutations in the substitution of Gly at ‘‘N1’’ in the non-syndromic group (Table 1) represents a pair of male monozygotic twins (4 years old) who were considered as one participant.
The number of missing teeth in both boys was 26.The nucleotide sequence showed a G to C transition at nucleotide 769 (c.769G.C) of the coding sequence in exon 7 of EDA, which results residue 257 to Arg Additionally, the nucleotide sequence showed a monoallelic C to T transition at nucleotide 511 (c.511C.T) of the coding sequence in exon 3 of WNT10A, which results in the substitution of Arg at residue 171 to Cys.
DNA sequencing of the parents’ genome revealed that both mutant alleles were from their mother (Fig.
2A), who carried a heterozygous EDA mutation (c.769G.C) and a heterozygous WNT10A c.511C.T mutation, and showed absence of only the left upper lateral incisor without other clinical abnormalities.
No mutations in these genes were found in the father ‘‘N2’’ is a 6-year-old boy who was normal except for the absence of 24 teeth (Table 1).
The p.Ile312Met (c.936C.G) mutation in EDA and heterozygous p.Arg171Cys (c.511C.T) mutation in WNT10A were detected.

2B) Clinical examination showed that maxillary lateral incisors on both sides and the left mandibular second molar were missing in the mother, but there were no anomalies in other organs.
The father did not have any mutations for these genes ‘‘S1’’ is a 14-year-old boy who had 21 permanent teeth missing (Table 1).
The nucleotide sequence showed a T deletion at nucleotide 252 (c.252DelT) of the coding sequence in exon 1 of EDA; this leads to a frame shift from residue 84 and a premature termination at residue 90.
Additionally, a monoallelic C to T transition at nucleotide 511 (c.511C.T) of the coding sequence in exon 3 of WNT10A was detected, this leads to the substitution of Arg at residue 171 to Cys.
Analyses of his parents’ genome showed the mutant EDA allele was from his mother (Fig.
2C), that however, we were unable to screen for WNT10A mutations because of insufficient DNA ‘‘S2’’ is a 17-year-old boy who had curly hair, 17 missing permanent teeth and hypohidrosis, his skin and nails were normal (Fig.
1 and Table 1).The p.Arg153Cys (c.457C.T) mutation was found in exon 3 of EDA, it results in the substitution of Arg at residue 153 to Cys.
Moreover, a heterozygous p.Gly213Ser (c.637G.A) mutation was detected in exon 3 of WNT10A, this leads to the substitution of Gly at residue 213 to Ser.
Sequence analyses revealed that both mutant alleles were from his mother (Fig.
2D), who had a very mild phenotype of isolated tooth agenesis.
His father did not have mutations in either of these genes ‘‘S3’’ is a 14-year-old girl who had the typical clinical characteristics of HED: sparse hair, 26 missing permanent teeth, hypohidrosis, dry skin, and eczema on her body, but no plantar hyperkeratosis or nail abnormalities (Table 1).
The heterozygous p.Arg156Cys (c.466C.T) mutation was found in exon 3 of EDA, it results residue 156 to Cys Additionally, the monoallelic p.Gly213Ser (c.637G.A) mutation was also detected in exon 3 of WNT10A, it results in the substitution of Gly at residue 213 to Ser.
Sequence analyses of her parents’ genome revealed that the mutant alleles were from her mother (Fig.
