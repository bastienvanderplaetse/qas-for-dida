Abstract Background: Usher syndrome (USH) combines sensorineural deafness with blindness.
It is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode.
Early diagnosis is critical for adapted educational and patient management choices, and for genetic counseling.
To date, nine causative genes have been identified for the three clinical subtypes (USH1, USH2 and USH3).
Current diagnostic strategies make use of a genotyping microarray that is based on the previously reported mutations.
The purpose of this study was to design a more accurate molecular diagnosis tool Methods: We sequenced the 366 coding exons and flanking regions of the nine known USH genes, in 54 USH patients (27 USH1, 21 USH2 and 6 USH3) Results: Biallelic mutations were detected in 39 patients (72%) and monoallelic mutations in an additional 10 patients (18.5%).
In addition to biallelic mutations in one of the USH genes, presumably pathogenic mutations in another USH gene were detected in seven patients (13%), and another patient carried monoallelic mutations in three different USH genes.
Notably, none of the USH3 patients carried detectable mutations in the only known USH3 gene, whereas they all carried mutations in USH2 genes.
Most importantly, the currently used microarray would have detected only 30 of the 81 different mutations that we found, of which 39 (48%) were novel Conclusions: Based on these results, complete exon sequencing of the currently known USH genes stands as a definite improvement for molecular diagnosis of this disease, which is of utmost importance in the perspective of gene therapy Background Usher syndrome (USH, MIM 276900, MIM 276905, MIM 605472) combines sensorineural hearing impair- ment with retinitis pigmentosa [1].
In addition, vestibu- lar dysfunction can be observed in some patients.

Three clinical sub- types can be distinguished.
USH type I (USH1) is char- acterized by severe to profound congenital hearing impairment, prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular arreflexia.
USH type II (USH2) combines congenital moderate to severe hearing impairment, onset of retinitis pigmentosa in the first or second dec- ade of life, and absence of vestibular dysfunction © 2011 Bonnet et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

USH is inherited in the autosomal recessive mode, and is genetically hetero- geneous.
To date, nine causative genes have been identi- fied.
Mutations in MYO7A [2], USH1C [3,4], CDH23 [5,6], PCDH15 [7,8] and USH1G [9] cause USH1, muta- tions in USH2A [10], VLGR1 [11] and WHRN [12] cause USH2, and mutations in USH3A [13] cause USH3.
Mutations in MYO7A [14-16], USH1C [17,18], CDH23 [6], PCDH15 [17] and WHRN [19] have also been reported in patients affected by hearing impair- ment only, while USH2A is also involved in isolated reti- nitis pigmentosa [20] The USH1 genes encode the actin-based motor pro- tein myosin VIIa (USH1B), two Ca2+-dependent trans- membrane adhesion proteins, cadherin-23 (USH1D) and protocadherin-15 (USH1F), the PDZ domain-containing submembrane protein harmonin (USH1C), and the scaf- fold protein sans that contains ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif domain (USH1G).
The USH2 genes encode two large transmembrane proteins, usherin (USH2A) and VLGR1 (very large G protein-coupled receptor, USH2C), and the PDZ domain-containing sub- membrane protein whirlin (USH2D).
Finally, USH3A encodes the four-transmembrane-domain protein clarin- 1.
Each USH gene encodes several protein isoforms, except MYO7A and USH1G Absence of an early diagnosis of USH is devastating.
In USH1 patients, sign language becomes a less and less efficient mode of communication as the visual defect pro- gresses, and ultimately, the patients may become unable to communicate except by tactile exchanges.
As a result of an early diagnosis of USH1, early bilateral cochlear implantation allowing the development of an oral mode of communication and early physical therapy for vestibu- lar disorders are strongly recommended.
The early diag- nosis is also critical for genetic counseling, educational orientation and therapeutic management, which may include retinal gene therapy in the future [21,22].
So far, a comprehensive molecular diagnosis of USH has been hampered both by the genetic heterogeneity of the dis- ease and the large number of exons for six out of the nine known USH genes.
The five USH1, three USH2, and one USH3 genes are collectively composed of 183, 173, and five coding exons, respectively [23] Cremers and collaborators have developed a genotyp- ing microarray for USH, based on the arrayed primer extension (APEX) method.
This approach, in a first ver- sion, included the analysis of 298 USH-associated sequence variants located in eight genes: MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1G, USH2A, VLGR1 and USH3A [24].
The mutations detected by the array subsequently increased, and currently include 612 pre- viously identified disease-associated variants in the nine known USH genes [25].
The selected variants were pre- valent in the following European countries: Belgium, Denmark, UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Netherlands, and in the USA.
The authors could prove that the chip, with >98% accuracy, is an adaptable and affordable mutation screening tool.
However, the effi- ciency of the chip was both dependent on the USH sub- type examined and the studied population, ranging from 30% in the USA to 80% in Denmark in USH1 cases [24] Recently, Jaijo et al., using an intermediate genotyping microarray (429 reported mutations), found mutations in only 34% of the patients tested [26], which is indicative of a large number of private mutations.
Therefore, improve- ment of the molecular diagnosis is needed Alternative strategies include direct sequencing of USH gene coding exons [27-30].
To determine the most efficient strategy, some critical information is, however, still lacking.
Is the clinically diagnosed USH subtype a reliable indication of the causative gene? What is the frequency of digenic/oligogenic inheritance in this dis- ease? Such a mode of inheritance is suggested by the colocalization and direct in vitro interactions of the USH1 proteins [31-39], and of the USH2 proteins [40,41].
In a few USH1 patients, digenic inheritance involving PCDH15 and CDH23 has indeed been reported [42].
To address these issues, we undertook a large-scale mutation screening of all currently known USH genes in a cohort of 54 USH patients Subjects and Methods Subjects Fifty-four unrelated Caucasian patients including five patients originating from Maghreb were included in the study.
Most patients were referred to Armand-Trous- seau Children’s Hospital in Paris, and other patients were referred to genetic consultations throughout France.
All patients were tested by audiograms and elec- troretinogram.
Auditory function was assessed by oto- scopy, tympanometry, standard pure tone audiometry, and recording of auditory brainstem responses and otoa- coustic emissions.
The cochlear origin of the hearing impairment was confirmed by auditory brainstem responses, and by the absence of otoacoustic emissions USH was diagnosed on the basis of simultaneous occur- rence of sensorineural deafness and retinal degeneration Scrutiny of the time of onset, evolution and severity of the hearing impairment, and quality of vestibular responses enabled to assign the patients to one of the three clinical types of the disease [43].
Patients were considered as USH3 when their hearing impairment had been detected in adulthood and showed clear progres- siveness.
For function these patients, vestibular Bonnet et al.

Parents of most of the patients were available for the study, and had normal hearing.
This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written consent for genetic test- ing was obtained from adult probands or parents of minor patients PCR amplification and sequencing Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard procedures.
The coding exons and flank- ing intronic sequences of all nine USH genes were amplified and sequenced using forward and reverse pri- mers (primer sequences and conditions available upon request).
We also searched for the previously reported 684 kb deletion in PCDH15 using the reported primers [44].
Sequences were run on ABI 3100 DNA analyzer, and assembled using ABI Prism Seqscape 2.1 to Gen- bank reference sequences [45] Control DNAs The genomic DNAs from 153 unaffected Caucasian control individuals were sequenced (306 control alleles) For the mutations possibly involved in oligogenic inheri- tance, DNAs from 333 healthy unrelated Caucasian indi- viduals were used as controls.
For the mutations present in patients originating from Maghreb, the DNAs from 95 Moroccan and 91 Algerian healthy unrelated indivi- duals were used as controls In silico analysis of sequence variants The SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant) [46] and Polyphen [47] software programs were used to predict the influence of any amino acid substitution on the pro- tein structure and function.
NetGene2 [48] and “Splice site prediction by neural network” [49] interfaces were used to predict the influence of nucleic acid substitu- tions on splice donor and acceptor sites.
Presence of Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESE) was detected using ESE Finder [50] Segregation analysis Segregation of all sequence variants identified in the patients was studied by sequencing the corresponding DNA fragments in the parents and other relatives.
In all patients carrying two distinct mutations in a given USH gene, biallelic transmission was confirmed by the segre- gation analysis Mutation nomenclature The mutation nomenclature complies with the mutation nomenclature correction tool Mutalyzer [51] according to the HGVS Guidelines & Recommendations [52].
The +1 position in mutation numbering corresponds to the A of the ATG initiation codon Protein Accession numbers MYO7A, [Swiss-Prot:Q13402]; USH1C, [Swiss-Prot: Q7RTU8]; CDH23, [Swiss-Prot:Q9H251]; PCDH15-CD1, [Swiss-Prot:Q96QU1]; PCDH15-CD2, [NCBI-RefSeq: NP_001136241.1]; PCDH15-CD3, [Swiss-Prot:C9J4F3]; USH1G, [Swiss- Prot:075445]; VLGR1, [Swiss-Prot:Q8WXG9]; WHRN, [Swiss-Prot:Q9P202]; USH3A, [Swiss-Prot:P58418] and [Swiss-Prot:P58418-1] for “a” and “c” variants, respectively [Swiss-Prot:Q495M9]; USH2A, Results Mutation analysis: high prevalence of novel mutations We analyzed the nine USH genes in a cohort of 54 French patients, of whom 27 were affected by USH1, 21 by USH2, and six by USH3.
From the patient and parent questionnaires, consanguinity was established for nine families (see Table 1).
Sequencing of the coding and non coding exons of all currently known USH genes was carried out in every patient.
Screening for predicted causative missense and splice site mutations was per- formed using prediction software programs.
Amino acid substitutions were considered likely to be pathogenic missense mutations when predicted possibly or probably deleterious by Polyphen software and not-tolerated by the SIFT program.
Nucleotide variations were consid- ered likely to be splice site mutations when predicted highly confident donor or acceptor site mutations by Netgene2 and “Splice site prediction by neural network” programs.
These sequence variants were ultimately clas- sified as presumably pathogenic mutations only if the affected amino acid residues were evolutionarily con- served (Additional file 1 Figures S1 to S3) and/or these variants were not found in the control individuals (see Subjects and Methods) A total of 81 distinct, presumably pathogenic muta- tions were detected, specifically, 16 nonsense mutations, five nucleotide duplications, 17 frame-shifting deletions, seven splicing defect-causing mutations, 34 missense mutations, and one isocoding variation.
Thirty-nine (48%) of these mutations, i.e.
27% to 100% of the muta- tions found in each USH gene, had not been previously reported (Tables 2, 3 and 4, Figure 1).
In addition, 103 amino acid substitutions were classified as presumably nonpathogenic sequence variants, including 33 new var- iants and six variants that had previously been reported as pathogenic mutations (Table 5).
Numerous, presum- ably neutral, isocoding and intronic variants were also observed (listed in Additional file 2, Table S1) Twenty-six pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in MYO7A were found in 19 patients, specifi- cally, eight nonsense mutations, one nucleotide duplica- tion, five nucleotide deletions, four splice site mutations, and eight missense mutations.
Seven of these mutations had not been previously reported, including two Bonnet et al.

C (2nd column) denotes consanguinity nonsense mutations (p.K164X, p.C1198X), a nucleotide duplication (c.397dupC; p.H133fsX7), a nucleotide dele- tion c.3904delT (p.Y1302fsX97), a nucleotide substitu- tion (c.1690+1G>A) predicted to alter the splice donor site of intron 14, and two missense mutations (p.K268R and p.P1220L) that change amino acid residues located in the motor head and the first MyTH4 domain of the myosin VIIa tail, respectively (Tables 2, 3 and Figure 1) Three distinct pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in USH1C were detected in three patients, spe- cifically, a nucleotide duplication (c.238_239dupC; p R80fsX69) already reported in several patients [3,4,27,53], a known missense mutation (p.R103H) affecting an amino acid residue located in the PDZ1 domain of the protein [27], and a novel missense mutation (p.R357W), predicted to affect the first coiled-coil domain of the pro- tein.
These mutations are expected to affect the three classes of harmonin isoforms (Tables 2, 3, Figure 1) [4] Eight pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in CDH23 were found in six patients, specifically, a pre- viously reported mutation that affects splicing (c.6050- 9G>A) [54], a novel nucleotide deletion (c.6404_64 05delAG; p.E2135fsX31), and six missense mutations [55,56], four of which (p.R1189W, p.R1379P, p.D2639G, and p.R3043W) had not been previously reported.
They affect amino acid residues located in the 11th, 13th and 25th cadherin repeat and the extracellular region adja- cent to the transmembrane domain (3065-3085), respec- tively (Tables 2, 3 Figure 1).
Intriguingly, the p.R1060W mutation, which affects a residue in the 10th cadherin repeat that belongs to a canonical motif (DRE) predicted to bind Ca2+ [57], has previously been reported in an isolated form of deafness, DFNB12 (cited in Astuto et al.
[55]) Two pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in PCDH15, specifically, a nonsense mutation (p.R991X) [27] and a novel missense mutation (p.R1273S), were found in two patients.
The missense mutation affects an amino acid residue located immediately after the 11th cadherin repeat (Tables 2, 3, Figure 1).
The large geno- mic rearrangement in PCDH15 previously reported by Le Guedard et al.
[44] was not detected in this group of patients [p.E767fsX21] + [p.R303H] [p.G2752R] + [c.5776+1G>A] [p.N4885S] [p.D1944N] [p.R379W] Three pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in USH1G were found in three patients, specifically, an already reported nonsense mutation (p.W38X) [58], a novel nucleotide duplication (c.84dupC; p.D29fsX29), and a novel sequence variant (c.46C>G; p.L16V).
This variant was absent from the control DNAs (0/666 alleles) and, according to the prediction software pro- grams (NetGene2 and ESE finder), should create a splice donor site resulting in a premature stop codon at codon position 17 (Tables 2, 3; Figure 1) deletions frame-shifting Twenty-five pathogenic or presumably pathogenic mutations in USH2A were found in 17 patients includ- ing three USH3 patients, specifically, five nonsense mutations, one nucleotide duplication, six nucleotide deletions [59], two splice site mutations, 10 missense mutations, and one isocoding variation possibly creating a splice donor site (Tables 2, 3).
All these mutations affect the extracellular region of usherin (Figure 1).
Nine mutations had not been previously reported, specifically, five (c.4030_4037del ATGGCTGG/p.M1344fsX42, c.5189_5199delATATGT TTCAT/p.Y1730fsX6, c.7522delT/p.R2509fsX19, c.89 70_8971delCA/p.T2991fsX61, and c.12381_12382delCT/ p.Y4128fsX24), one splice acceptor site mutation (c.10586-1G>C) that is expected to result in exon 54 skipping and premature termination of the protein, and three missense mutations (p.C575Y, p.G1301V, p C3307W) that affect amino acid residues located in the 14th fibronectin type III domain and the trideca-di- cysteine domain (residue 3192 to 3371) between the 18th and the 19th fibronectin type III domains (Figure 1).
Notably, the isocoding mutation (c.949C>A; p R317R) has been predicted to be pathogenic by Pen- nings [60] and considered as nonpathogenic by Dreyer [28].
Segregation analysis in our family was compatible with a pathogenic effect of this mutation (Additional file 1 Figure S4) Eleven pathogenic or presumably pathogenic muta- tions in VLGR1 were detected in eight patients including two USH3 patients.
All were novel mutations, specifi- cally, a nonsense mutation (p.E4321X), a nucleotide duplication (c.1563dupT; p.P552fsX8), four nucleotide deletions (c.333_334delTT/p.F112fsX29, c.2258_2270del Bonnet et al.
