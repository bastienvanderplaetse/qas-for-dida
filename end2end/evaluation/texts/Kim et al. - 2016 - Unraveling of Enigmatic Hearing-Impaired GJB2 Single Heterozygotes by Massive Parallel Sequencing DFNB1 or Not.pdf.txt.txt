Abstract: The molecular etiology of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in subjects with only one detectable autosomal recessive GJB2 mutation is unclear.
Here, we report GJB2 single hetero- zygotes with various ﬁnal genetic diagnoses and suggest appropriate diagnostic strategies.
A total of 160 subjects with SNHL without pheno- typic markers were screened for GJB2 mutations.
Single-nucleotide variants or structural variations within the DFNB1 locus or in other deafness genes were examined by Sanger sequencing, breakpoint PCR, and targeted exome sequencing (TES) of 129 deafness genes.
We identiﬁed 27 subjects with two mutations and 10 subjects with only one detectable mutation in GJB2.
The detection rate of the single GJB2 mutation among the 160 SNHL subjects in the present study (6.25%) was higher than 2.58% in normal hearing controls in Korean.
The DFNB1 was clearly excluded as a molecular etiology in four (40%) subjects: other recessive deafness genes (N¼ 3) accounted for SNHL and the causative gene for the other non-DFNB1 subject (N¼ 1) was not identiﬁed.
The etiology of additional two subjects was potentially explained by digenic etiology (N¼ 2) of GJB2 with MITF and GJB3, respectively.
The contribution of the single GJB2 mutation in the four remaining subjects is unclear.
