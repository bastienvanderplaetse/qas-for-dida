ARTICLE Transcriptional Control of SLC26A4 Is Involved in Pendred Syndrome and Nonsyndromic Enlargement of Vestibular Aqueduct (DFNB4) Tao Yang, Hilmar Vidarsson, Sandra Rodrigo-Blomqvist, Sally S.

H.Smith Although recessive mutations in the anion transporter gene SLC26A4 are known to be responsible for Pendred syndrome (PS) and nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), also known as “DFNB4,” a large percentage of patients with this phenotype lack mutations in the SLC26A4 coding region in one or both alleles.
We have identiﬁed and characterized a key transcriptional regulatory element in the SLC26A4 promoter that binds FOXI1, a transcriptional activator of SLC26A4.
In nine patients with PS or nonsyndromic EVA, a novel c.5103TrC mutation in this regulatory element interferes with FOXI1 binding and completely abolishes FOXI1-mediated transcriptional acti- vation.
We have also identiﬁed six patients with mutations in FOXI1 that compromise its ability to activate SLC26A4 transcription.
In one family, the EVA phenotype segregates in a double-heterozygous mode in the affected individual who carries single mutations in both SLC26A4 and FOXI1.
This ﬁnding is consistent with our observation that EVA occurs in the Slc26a4+/5; Foxi1+/5 double-heterozygous mouse mutant.
These results support a novel dosage-dependent model for the molecular pathogenesis of PS and nonsyndromic EVA that involves SLC26A4 and its transcriptional regulatory machinery Pendred syndrome (PS [MIM 274600]) accounts for up to 10% of hereditary hearing loss in humans, making it the most common form of syndromic deafness.1 It is in- herited in an autosomal recessive manner and has been causally linked to mutations in the coding sequence of SLC26A4 (MIM 605646; GenBank accession number NC_000007.12).2,3 The disease phenotype is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss; structural malformation of the inner ear, such as enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (EVA [MIM 603545]) with or without cochlear dysplasia; and defects in iodide transport that can lead to goitrous changes of the thyroid gland.
Consistent with this phe- notype, SLC26A4 mRNA and the encoded protein pendrin are found in the inner ear and thyroid.
In the inner ear, pendrin is expressed in external sulcal cells and the en- dolymphatic duct and sac—regions involved in endo- lymph homeostasis4—and, in the thyroid, pendrin is ex- pressed in the apical membrane of thyrocytes, where it regulates iodide ﬂux into thyroid follicles.5,6 In addition to PS, mutations in SLC26A4 also cause nonsyndromic hearing loss with EVA in the absence of a thyroid phe- notype (DFNB4 [MIM 600791]).7,8 Familial cases of both PS and nonsyndromic EVA sup- port the recessive inheritance of this disease spectrum.
In previous reports,7,9,10 as well as in our current study (table 1), however, many patients segregate only one or no mu- tations in the SLC26A4 coding region, suggesting that en- vironmental or other genetic factors may contribute to disease expression.
The transcription-factor gene FOXI1 (MIM 601093) has been proposed as a candidate that may contribute to the genetic cause of PS.
Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of Foxi1 are deaf and have EVA.11 Furthermore, there is complete absence of Slc26a4 (GenBank accession number NC_000078.4) expression in the epithelial cells of endolymphatic duct and sac in these mice, where normally both Foxi1 and Slc26a4 mes- sages are present.
These data suggest that Foxi1 (GenBank accession number NP_076396.2) is an upstream regulator of Slc26a4.12 In this study, we show that transcriptional control of SLC26A4 expression involves a key cis-regula- tory element in the SLC26A4 promoter and its associated transcription factor FOXI1 (GenBank accession number NP_036320.2), both of which play a role in the patho- genesis of PS and nonsyndromic EVA Subjects and Methods Subjects Persons with EVA or Mondini dysplasia were ascertained clinically on the basis of the presence of hearing loss and ﬁndings of tem- poral bone CT or magnetic resonance imaging.
In addition to these studies, their evaluation included a complete history and physical examination.
Thyroid defects were recorded but were not used as classiﬁcation criteria.

All procedures were approved by the institutional re- view board at the University of Iowa, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects Mutation Screening Mutation screening was performed by denaturing high-perfor- mance liquid chromatography and bidirectional sequencing on DNA extracted from whole blood, as we have described else- where.13,14 Mutation screening of SLC26A4 promoter and FOXI1 was completed in all patients with (1) one mutation in SLC26A4 or (2) no mutations in SLC26A4 but with either an affected sibling or a classic PS phenotype (Mondini dysplasia with or without goiter) Luciferase Assay FOXI1 was PCR ampliﬁed and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/zeo(⫹) vector (Invitrogen).
The 5-kb genomic region upstream of the SLC26A4 start codon was ampliﬁed from control genomic DNA by long-range PCR and was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3.0 Basic (Promega).
Mutant FOXI1 and SLC26A4 pro- moter constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, by use of the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) The SLC26A4 promoter-reporter assay was performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
In brief, COS-7 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 750 ng FOXI1 construct and 250 ng luciferase reporter construct, with use of FUGENE 6 Transfection reagent (Roche).
In place of FOXI1 constructs, 750 ng pcDNA3.1/zeo(⫹) empty vector was used in controls.
Before each luciferase assay, cell growth medium was carefully removed Cells were washed with PBS once, were mixed with 100 ml of 1# lysis buffer, and were frozen at ⫺20⬚C for 20 min.
Cells and all lysates were scraped and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, were vortexed for 15 s, and were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min at 4⬚C.
From each sample, 20 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate for automatic luciferase activity assay.
Luciferase activities were determined as fold induction compared with activities of corresponding control cells trans- fected with 750 ng empty pcDNA3.1/zeo(⫹) vector and were nor- malized to the total protein level measured by Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Sigma).
Experiments were performed in at least triplicate Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay FOXI1 protein was transcribed in vitro and was translated using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Pro- mega).
As the DNA template, 1 mg pSP64 Poly(A) expression plas- mid with the full FOXI1 coding sequence was used.
Mobility shift reactions were performed in 1# binding buffer (5 mM HEPES, 26% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithio- threitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 100 mM KCl [pH 7.9]) supplemented with 1 ml poly d(I-C) in a 15-ml re- action.
Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5(cid:1)-end la- beled with use of a32P-CTP and Klenow polymerase.
Binding re- actions contained 5#104 cpm of labeled probe, the indicated amount of unlabeled competitor probe, and 3 ml protein lysate Binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and were resolved using a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel Electrophoresis was performed at 4⬚C at 200 V for 1.5 h, and the gel was subjected to radioautography.
Band intensity was quan- tiﬁed using the AlphaEaseFC imaging system and software (Alpha Innotech) Histology The morning that vaginal plugs were detected was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).
Tails from embryos were collected for genotyping by use of PCR as described above.
Embryos were ﬁxed overnight in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4⬚C.
For histology, embryos were dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁn wax, and 6- mm sections were cut.
Tissue sections were stained with hema- toxylin and eosin for histological analysis.
At least four mice of each genotype were analyzed at E16.5 Results Identiﬁcation of an SLC26A4 Promoter Mutation Associated with PS and Nonsyndromic EVA We completed mutation screening of the SLC26A4 coding region in 429 deaf probands given a diagnosis of EVA with or without cochlear dysplasia (table 1).
In 31 multiplex families with two or more affected siblings, only 12 (39%) had sibships that segregated two disease-causing allele var- iants of SLC26A4; in the remaining 398 simplex families, the percentage was much lower (11%, or 45 families).
In- terestingly, one disease-causing mutation was identiﬁed in 6 multiplex and 69 simplex families (17% of all fami- lies).
This ﬁnding suggested that additional genetic factors are involved in PS and nonsyndromic EVA To study additional genetic causes of this disease, we ﬁrst searched for mutations in the noncoding region of SLC26A4 by screening its promoter.
Three highly homol- ogous regions in the 5-kb upstream sequence of SLC26A4 were found by comparing human and mouse genomes Mutation screening of these regions revealed a TrC single- nucleotide change 103 bp upstream of the SLC26A4 trans- lation start in nine families with PS or nonsyndromic EVA This c.⫺103TrC mutation is within an evolutionarily con- served nucleotide among many mammalian species (ﬁg 1A) and was not seen in 100 unrelated controls with nor- mal hearing Functional Characterization of the Promoter Mutation and the Embracing Regulatory Cis-Element On the basis of comparison with the TRTTKRY FOXI1 R p A/G K p G/T Y p consensus binding sequence ( )15,16 the c.⫺103TrC promoter mutation lies within C/T ; ; 1056 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 80 June 2007 www.ajhg.org FOXI1-binding afﬁnity to wild-type and mutant (c.⫺103TrC) FBS1.

⫹ p Wild-type allele was introduced into the SLC26A4 promoter-reporter con- struct, FOXI1 transactivation of the luciferase reporter was completely abolished (ﬁg.
2).The effect was identical if FBS1 was deleted, implying that this binding site is a major transcriptional regulatory element of SLC26A4 and is required for FOXI1-induced transcriptional activation of SLC26A4 We identiﬁed a second FOXI1-binding site, called “FBS2,” 2 nt downstream of FBS1.
FBS2 is also highly conserved across species and is a perfect match to the TRTTKRY consensus binding sequence, although in the reverse ori- entation to FBS1 (ﬁg.
1A).Flipping either FBS1 or FBS2 in the SLC26A4 promoter-reporter construct completely abolishes any response to FOXI1 transcriptional activation (ﬁg.
2), suggesting that the unique head-to-head orien- tation of these tandem binding sites is necessary for FOXI1 to form a functional transcriptional-activation complex Identiﬁcation and Characterization of FOXI1 Mutations We further asked whether mutations in FOXI1 contribute to the PS-EVA disease spectrum.
Mutation screening of FOXI1 revealed ﬁve nonsynonymous variants of FOXI1 in six patients (table 2).
Three of these mutations—161DelN, R267Q, and G335V—are conserved between human and mouse, and the remaining two involve Gly258, changing this small noncharged amino acid into either arginine or glutamate, both of which are substantially more bulky (ﬁg.
3).One mutation, 161DelN, is also unique, in that it lies within the conserved forkhead DNA-binding domain None of the ﬁve mutations was seen in 250 unrelated controls with normal hearing screened for FOXI1 To study the possible effects of these FOXI1 mutations, we ﬁrst completed immunoﬂuorescence assays of FOXI1 in mammalian cells transfected with mutant and wild- type FOXI1 constructs and found that nuclear translo- cation of the mutant protein was not altered (data not shown).
We then used the same promoter-reporter assay system described in the promoter mutation study, to test whether the FOXI1 mutations affect transcriptional acti- vation.
Compared with the sixfold induction of luciferase expression by wild-type FOXI1, all ﬁve FOXI1 variants showed signiﬁcantly decreased luciferase activation (ﬁg 4).
These results suggest that the variants in these patients compromise FOXI1 transactivation ability of SLC26A4 Figure 2 Luciferase assay showing complete loss of FOXI1 tran- scriptional activation in mutant and modiﬁed promoter-reporter constructs.

Results from three independent experiments are shown (meanⳲSD) a predicted FOXI1-binding site highly conserved across mammalian species, which we called “FBS1” (ﬁg.
1A).We conﬁrmed binding of FOXI1 to FBS1 by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), which showed that the c.⫺103TrC mutation signiﬁcantly reduces FOXI1-bind- ing afﬁnity (ﬁg.
1B) To determine whether this promoter mutation directly affects the transcription of SLC26A4, we used the lucif- erase promoter-reporter expression assay.
Five kilobases of the upstream sequence of SLC26A4 were fused to the luciferase reporter gene in the promoter-reporter con- struct, which was transfected into COS-7 cells with FOXI1- expressing constructs (see the “Subjects and Methods” section).
Compared with controls transfected with empty vector, wild-type FOXI1 induced a sixfold increase in lu- ciferase activity.

The amino acid changes identiﬁed in patients with PS and nonsyndromic expression and are causally related to disease in these patients Double-Heterozygosity Model of Nonsyndromic EVA In one family (82210) with hearing loss and nonsyn- dromic EVA, the disease phenotype segregates in a dou- ble-heterozygous mode, with the mother carrying the SLC26A4 E29Q mutation, the father carrying the FOXI1 G258E mutation, the affected child carrying both muta- tions, and the unaffected child carrying the SLC26A4 E29Q mutation only.
Allele segregation in this family also supports double heterozygosity, in that both siblings in- herited the same two SLC26A4 alleles from their parents, indicating that the difference in the phenotypes between those two siblings is caused by mutations at another locus (ﬁg.
5) We crossed Slc26a4⫹/⫺ and Foxi1⫹/⫺ mice to determine whether this animal model supports double heterozy- gosity.
Both Slc26a4⫺/⫺ and Foxi1⫺/⫺ mutants develop EVA, whereas their heterozygous counterparts are phe- notypically indistinguishable from wild-type controls In the Slc26a4⫹/⫺; Foxi1⫹/⫺ double-heterozygous mutant, however, temporal bone development is abnormal, and EVA is also observed (ﬁg.
6) Discussion Our work shows that the transcriptional machinery that controls SLC26A4 expression is involved in the PS-EVA disease spectrum.
This ﬁnding is consistent with reports by several investigators noting that many patients with a PS-EVA phenotype lack mutations in either one or both alleles of SLC26A4.7,9,10 Our database of 429 deaf probands given clinical diagnoses of PS or nonsyndromic EVA rep- resents the largest study to date to conﬁrm this observa- tion (table 1).
In only 39% of multiplex families and 11% of simplex families did we identify two SLC26A4 muta- tions; in 42% and 71% of multiplex and simplex families, respectively, no mutations were identiﬁed.

Both binding sites and this speciﬁc orientation are required for FOXI1-mediated tran- scriptional activation (ﬁg.
2).Two recent promoter-re- porter studies have shown that Foxi1 also activates tran- scription of two other ion transporter genes—Slc4a9 (MIM 610207; GenBank accession number NC_000084.4) en- ⫺/Cl⫺ exchanger in the type B in- coding AE4, an HCO3 tercalated cells of the renal collecting-duct epithelium,19 and Atp6v1b1 (MIM 192132; GenBank accession number NC_000072.4) encoding the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H⫹-ATPase proton pump in the apical pole of narrow and clear cells of the epididymis.20 Interestingly, adjacent to the reported Foxi1-binding cis-elements of both genes, we observed a second putative Foxi1-binding site that matches the FOXI1 consensus binding sequence and is in the opposite orientation (ﬁg.
7).We hypothesize that this unique head-to-head arrangement is a conserved FOXI1- Figure 5 Segregation of SLC26A4 and FOXI1 mutations in family 82230.
Parents carry a single mutation in either SLC26A4 or FOXI1, the affected child carries both mutations, and her unaffected sister carries the SLC26A4 mutation only.
Both siblings inherited the same wild-type SLC26A4 allele from their father Figure 4 The transcriptional activation ability of FOXI1 vari- ants, as measured using a luciferase assay.
Together with 750 ng of empty vector (EV), FOXI1 wild-type construct (WT), or one of the ﬁve FOXI1 mutant constructs, 250 ng of promoter-reporter construct was transfected into COS-7 cells.
Reporter-gene activity was quantitated as “fold induction” relative to the empty vector control.
Results from three independent experiments are shown (meanⳲSD); the activity of each mutant FOXI1 construct has been compared with that of the wild-type construct (P values calculated by two-tailed Student’s t test) ronmental factors but are also consistent with other pos- sibilities, including (1) the presence of large deletions in SLC26A4 that are not recognized by our screening meth- odology; (2) mutations in the noncoding regions of SLC26A4, such as intronic cryptic splicing or promoter mutations; or (3) mutations in other genes that contribute in trans to cause a PS-EVA phenotype Our current PCR-based mutation-screening method does not distinguish hemizygosity from homozygosity at the genomic DNA level, making detection of large dele- tions challenging.
To address this problem, we completed real-time PCR or SNP genotyping in a group of patients n p 35 ( ) and failed to identify any large deletions (data not shown).
To address the second hypothesis, we com- pleted a detailed study of the promoter region of SLC26A4 and identiﬁed a cis-regulatory element critical for SLC26A4 expression.
This element is a binding target for the tran- scription factor FOXI1 and is required for FOXI1-mediated transcriptional activation of SLC26A4.
A mutation within this cis-element, c.⫺103TrC, completely abolishes this activation and was present in 9 of 429 patients, consis- tent with this mutation having a disease-causing role in the PS-EVA phenotype (ﬁgs.
1 and 2).Although we failed to identify a second SLC26A4 mutation in these families, it is not uncommon to detect a single disease-causing SLC26A4 mutation presumably in combination with a yet- to-be-identiﬁed mutation either in cis or in trans (table 3) Although other studies have described large genomic 1060 The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 80 June 2007 www.ajhg.org SNAI2 (MIM 602150), and SOX10 (MIM 602229) in Waardenburg syndrome types I–IV (WS1 [MIM 277580], WS2A [MIM 193510], WS3 [MIM 148820], and WS4 [MIM 277580])—lead to nonsyndromic or syndromic hearing impairment, to date, no speciﬁc downstream target genes have been found among those pathogenic pathways (He- reditary Hearing Loss Homepage).
Our work is the ﬁrst to link a transcription factor to its speciﬁc downstream gene in the pathogenesis of deafness Another interesting discovery resulting from this study is a family in which the disease phenotype shows a double- heterozygous inheritance pattern, with the affected child carrying single SLC26A4 and FOXI1 mutations (ﬁg.
5).Al- though other inheritance patterns, such as FOXI1 com- pound heterozygosity with a second yet-to-be-identiﬁed FOXI1 mutation, cannot be completely excluded, the pathogenicity of the double-heterozygous genotype is supported by several facts.
First, the Slc26a4⫹/-; Foxi1⫹/- mouse mutant has a similar phenotype (ﬁg.
6); second, the FOXI1 G258E mutation reduces transcription of SLC26A4 in vitro (ﬁg.
4); third, the SLC26A4 E29Q mu- tation has been reported previously in families segregating PS-EVA in association with other SLC26A4 mutations7,23; fourth, both the affected and the unaffected child have identical SLC26A4 genotypes, which is consistent with the presence of additional genetic mutations in the affected child (ﬁg.
5); and, ﬁfth, neither of these mutations has been reported in screens of 500 chromosomes To our knowledge, this example of digenic inheritance is the ﬁrst to be veriﬁed as a cause of human deafness Other studies have proposed a possible digenic role for two adjacent gap-junction genes, GJB2 and GJB6, in non- syndromic deafness at the DFNB1 locus, on the basis of reports of two large deletions that include the 5(cid:1) end of GJB6 and segregate with hearing loss when present in trans with a recessive mutation in GJB2.24–26 A recent study, however, shows that these deletions prevent expression of both GJB2 and GJB6,18 suggesting that the deafness is caused by loss of a yet-to-be-identiﬁed upstream cis-reg- Table 3 PS-EVAa SLC26A4 Mutation Frequency in Patients with No.

In support of this hypothesis, high-resolution structural studies show that FOXP2 (MIM 605317), another forkhead box-containing transcription factor, dimerizes though subdomain-swap- ping interfaces within the forkhead DNA-binding domain to bind to multiple DNA sites.21 Consistent with our third hypothesis, that mutations in other genes may contribute in trans to a PS-EVA pheno- type, we identiﬁed ﬁve FOXI1 mutations in six patients that compromise the transcriptional-activation ability of FOXI1 (table 2 and ﬁgs.
3 and 4).These data are the ﬁrst to link mutations in FOXI1 to PS-EVA in humans, although mice homozygous for the targeted deletion of Foxi1 have a phenotype that includes cochlear dysplasia and EVA.12 Also included in the Foxi1⫺/⫺ mouse phenotype are male infertility and distal renal tubular acidosis,20,22 two abnor- malities not yet reported in humans with PS or EVA On the basis of our results, we propose a dosage-depen- dent model for the pathogenesis of PS and nonsyndromic EVA that involves not only SLC26A4 but also its transcrip- tional control machinery.
Mutations in the SLC26A4 pro- moter in cis and the transcription factor FOXI1 in trans, when combined with conventional SLC26A4 mutations or possibly other yet-to-be-identiﬁed mutations, reduce gene expression levels to below the threshold required for normal inner ear and/or thyroid function, leading to a disease phenotype.
Notably, in none of the six patients with FOXI1 mutations was there a family history of hear- ing impairment, which supports the recessive or double- heterozygous nature of these mutations Although mutations in many transcription factors—in- cluding EYA1 (MIM 601653) and SIX1 (MIM 601205) in branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR [MIM 113650]), EYA4 (MIM 603550) in DFNA10 (MIM 601316), POU4F3 (MIM 602460) in DFNA15 (MIM 602459), POU3F4 in DFN3 (MIM 304400), GRHL2 (MIM 608576) in DFNA28 (MIM 608641), and PAX3 (MIM 606597), MITF (MIM 156845), www.ajhg.org The American Journal of Human Genetics Volume 80 June 2007 1061 GenBank, http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/ (for SLC26A4 [ac- cession number NC_000007.12], Slc26a4 [accession number NC_000078.4], Foxi1 [accession number NP_076396.2], FOXI1 [accession number NP_036320.2], Slc4a9 [accession number NC_000084.4], Atp6v1b1 [accession number NC_000072.4], SLC4A9 [accession number NC_000005.8], and ATP6V1B1 [ac- cession number NC_000002.10]) Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage, http://webh01.ua.ac.be/ hhh/ Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), http://www.ncbi .nlm.gov/Omim/ (for PS, SLC26A4, EVA, DFNB4, FOXI1, POU3F4, GJB2, Slc4a9, Atp6v1b1, FOXP2, EYA1, SIX1, BOR, EYA4, DFNA10, POU4F3, DFNA15, DFN3, GRHL2, DFNA28, PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, SOX10, WS1, WS2A, WS3, and WS4) UCSC Genome Browser, http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/ hgGateway/ (for the genomic sequence alignment) References 1.

Hulander M, Wurst W, Carlsson P, Enerback S (1998) The Figure 7 Sequence alignment in multiple species shows the head-to-head FOXI1-binding motif in the promoter region of SLC26A4, SLC4A9 (GenBank accession number NC_000005.8), and ATP6V1B1 (GenBank accession number NC_000002.10) (UCSC Ge- nome Browser).
The two adjacent FOXI1-binding sites are shown in boxes; arrows indicate orientation.
The binding sites experi- mentally conﬁrmed to be required for gene transcriptional acti- vation are in bold.
Numbers indicate the upstream position of the nucleotides relative to the translational start site ulatory element of GJB2, as opposed to loss of GJB6 expression As a model of double heterozygosity in which mutations in a transcription factor and its downstream target gene combine to produce to a disease phenotype, this ﬁnding implies that PS-EVA is a complex disease.
Most genetic disorders for which causative genes have been identiﬁed are monogenic, and little is known about how genetic factors interact to lead to polygenic disorders.
This bigenic disease model at the transcriptional-control level presents a novel oligogenic disease mechanism, which may guide gene-discovery efforts targeting complex diseases after one or a few genes have been implicated.
A dosage-dependent model based on transcriptional control also may explain some of the phenotypic variability that is common in complex diseases, especially those diseases in which mul- tiple tissues and organs are affected.
