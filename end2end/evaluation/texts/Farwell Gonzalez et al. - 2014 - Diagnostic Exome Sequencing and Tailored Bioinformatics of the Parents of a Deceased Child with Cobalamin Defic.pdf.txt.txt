Abstract Disorders of cobalamin deficiency are a hetero- geneous group of disorders with at least 19 autosomal recessive-associated genes.
Familial samples of an infant who died due to presumed cobalamin deficiency were referred for clinical exome sequencing.
The patient died before obtaining a blood sample or skin biopsy, autopsy was declined, and DNA yielded from the newborn screening blood spot was insuffi- cient for diagnostic testing.
Whole-exome sequencing of the mother, father, and unaffected sister and tailored bioinformatics analysis was applied to search for mutations in underlying disorders with recessive inheritance.
This approach identified alterations within two genes, each of which was carried by one parent.
The mother carried a missense alteration in the MTR gene (c.3518C>T; p.P1173L) which was absent in the father and the sister.
The father carried a translational frameshift alteration in the LMBRD1 gene (c.1056delG; p.L352Lfs*18) which was absent in the mother and present in the hetero- Communicated by: Matthias Baumgartner Competing interests: None declared Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2014_294) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users K.D.

These mutations in the MTR (MIM# 156570) and LMBRD1 (MIM# 612625) genes have been described in patients with disorders of cobalamin metabolism complementation groups cblG and cblF, respectively.
The child’s clinical presentation and biochemical results demon- strated overlap with both cblG and cblF.
Sanger sequencing using DNA from the infant’s blood spot confirmed the inheritance of the two alterations in compound heterozygous form.
We present the first example of exome sequencing leading to a diagnosis in the absence of the affected patient Furthermore, the possibility for potential digenic inheritance associated with cobalamin deficiency the data support Introduction The inborn errors of intracellular cobalamin metabolism are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and have been categorized based on complementation analysis and desig- nated mut (MIM #251000), cblA-cblG (MIM #25110, 277400, 277410, 236270, 277380, 250940) (reviewed in Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011), CblJ (MIM #614857) (Coelho et al.
2012), and CblX (Yu et al.2013).
Cobalamin deficiency generally leads to an accumulation of methylma- lonic acid and homocysteine in the blood and urine stemming from decreased activity of the enzymes methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase (Gulati et al.
1996, 1997; Gailus et al.
2010; Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011).Clinical symptoms generally include hematologic and neurologic defects (Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011).
However, even within a single complementation class clinical symptoms 30 JIMD Reports and biochemical profile can be highly variable, which led to the need to distinguish the disorders based on the affected gene (Froese and Gravel 2010).
Autosomal recessive mutations within at least 19 genes are associated with disorders of cobalamin metabolism.
To our knowledge, there have been no reports of digenic inheritance (Sarafoglou and Hoffman 2009; Froese and Gravel 2010) The number of patients diagnosed through research and clinical exome sequencing has increased exponentially since the inception of the technology in 2008 and the introduction of the clinical test in 2011 (NIH Health Consensus Confer- ence Statement, 2001; Worthey et al.
2011; Dixon-Salazar et al.
2012; Need et al.2012; Sailer et al.
2012; Hanchard et al.
2013; Shamseldin et al.2013).
Exome sequencing has been instrumental in discovering the pathogenic etiology in patients in whom traditional molecular methods were uninformative and is uniquely useful in overcoming limitations posed by traditional molecular diagnostic strat- egies in the identification of oligogenic findings.
A recent meta-analysis of digenic inheritance publications points out that despite the capacity of high-throughput sequencing to discover digenic inheritance, strikingly few reports have been published (between 1 and 7 annually), and the rate of discovery has not increased over the last decade (Schaffer 2013).
Often complicating the interpretation of genetic variants are factors such as reduced penetrance and variable expressivity, which has been, in part, attributed to a two- locus model (Strauch et al.
2003) To our knowledge, there are no reports of exome sequencing leading to a diagnosis in a patient using only DNA from the affected individual’s family members Herein, we describe this approach and the subsequent postmortem diagnosis of an affected neonate Subjects and Methods DNA from the mother, father, and sister of a patient with cobalamin deficiency were referred to Ambry Genetics (Aliso Viejo, CA) for clinical diagnostic exome sequencing (DES).
The patient had previously died at 3.5 months before DNA could be collected.
A newborn screening blood spot was available from the patient, providing sufficient DNA for Sanger sequencing confirmation of findings, but not for whole-exome sequencing due to limited DNA quantity and quality.
The family was consented for DES and research.
The patient was born to non-consanguineous parents after an unremarkable prenatal course.
Though B12 levels were not measured, the mother was on a normal diet including meat during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
At 27 4/7 weeks gestation, CBC was normal.
The patient was apparently healthy for the first 2.5 months.
Newborn screening was normal.Specifically, propionylcarnitine (C3) level at birth was 1.43 mmol/L (normal <7.0 mmol/L), propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) was 0.06 mmol/L (normal <0.20 mmol/L), methyl- malonylcarnitine (C4-DC) was 0.10 mmol/L (normal <1.00 mmol/L), and methionine was 0.08 mmol/L (normal <1.25 mmol/L).
At 2.5 months, he had recurring apnea episodes and was diagnosed with reflux.
He then presented with seizures 10 days later.
MRI showed brain atrophy with volume decrease and sulcal enlargement.
EEG was consis- tent with diffuse encephalopathy.
He had microcephaly with height and weight at the 50% tile.
Ammonia, lactate, and pyruvate were normal.
Total homocysteine was elevated at 125 mmol/L (normal 4.0–15.4 mmol/L).
Urine organic acids showed mild elevation of MMA (8, normal 0–5) and hydantoin-5-propionate.
Urine amino acids revealed homocystinuria (204 mM/gCR) and plasma amino acids showed low methionine (3, normal 10–60).
Serum MMA was 0.19 nmol/mL.
Vitamin B12 was low at 173 pg/ mL (211–946), but mom’s level was normal.
RBC folate was 580 ng/mL.
CSF amino acids showed normal methio- nine levels, and homocystine was not detected.
CSF neurotransmitter studies were normal (5-methylterahydro- folate in CSF was 59 nmol/L).
Blood smear was normal without megaloblastic anemia or cytopenia.
He was placed on daily hydroxocobalamin IM injections, betaine, B6, folate, and carnitine.
His homocysteine fell from 125.2 to 30.5 to 18.6.
His methionine increased from 3 to 12 in the same period.
RBC folate changed from 508 to 503.The patient was ventilated for nearly 2 weeks and failed extubation due to continued respiratory distress with paradoxical episodes of respiratory pauses.
He subse- quently died at 3.5 months Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (gDNA) was isolated from whole blood from each parent and the sister.
Samples were prepared using the SureSelect Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) (Gnirke et al.
2009).Briefly, each DNA sample was sheared, blunt- end repaired, and adaptor-ligated using indexed adapters Using solution-based hybridization with oligonucleotide probes, the coding exons and neighboring intronic sequence of the genome were enriched and the nontargeted sequences were washed away.
The enriched exome libraries were then applied to the solid surface flow cell for clonal amplifica- tion and sequencing using paired-end, 100 bp cycle chemistry on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Each sample was sequenced sufficiently to yield greater than 90% of the targeted region with at least 10x base-pair coverage and greater than 85% of targeted bases with quality score of Q30 or higher, which translates to an expected base-calling error rate of 1:1,000 or an expected base-calling accuracy of 99.9% Initial data processing and base calling, including intensities, was done using RTA extraction of cluster JIMD Reports 31 0 and 3 1.12.4 (HiSeq Control Software 1.4.5).
Sequence quality filtering script was executed with the Illumina CASAVA software (ver 1.8.2, Illumina, Hayward, CA).
Data yield (Mbases), %PF (pass filter), # of reads, % of raw clusters per lane, and quality scores were examined in Demulti- plex_Stats.htm file.
The sequence data were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh37) and variant calls were generated using CASAVA and PINDEL (Ye et al.
2009) 0 Exons plus at least two bases into the 5 ends of all the introns were analyzed.
Data analysis focused on nonsense variants, small insertions and deletions, canonical splice site alterations, or non-synonymous missense alterations.
The human gene mutation database (HGMD) (Strauch et al 2003), the single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) (Sherry et al.
2001), 1,000 Genomes (1000, Genomes Project Consortium, 2010), HapMap data (Interna- tional HapMap C 2003), and online search engines (e.g., PubMed) were used to search for previously described gene mutations and polymorphisms.
The filtering pipeline protects all variants annotated within the HGMD (Stenson et al 2009) and/or the online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) databases.
Stepwise filtering included the removal 0 of common SNPs, intergenic and 3 UTR variants, non- splice-related intronic variants, and lastly synonymous variants.
Variants were then filtered further based on family history and possible inheritance models.
Data are annotated with the ambry variant analyzer tool (AVA), including nucleotide and amino acid conservation, biochemical nature of amino acid substitutions, population frequency (ESP and 1,000 genomes), and predicted functional impact (including PolyPhen (Gitiaux et al.
2013) and SIFT (Grohmann et al 2004) in silico prediction tools).
Each candidate mutation was assessed by a molecular geneticist to identify the most likely causative mutation(s).
Multiple sequence alignments were viewed using IGV (integrative genomics viewer) software (Robinson et al.
2011) 0 /5 Nonstandard bioinformatics filtering was performed in order to search for gene alterations which may have been transmitted to the deceased son.
Specifically, analysis was performed to search for mutations in recessive genes carried by both the mother and father and not present in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in the sister, as well as for X-linked recessive genes carried by mother This analysis included all captured genes, including clinically novel genes.
Additionally, a manual review of the known cobalamin deficiency genes was performed including the following genes: ABCD4, AMN, CD320, CUBN, FTCD, GIF, HCFC1, LMBRD1, MCEE, MMAA, MMAB, MMACHC, MMADHC, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, MUT, PCFT, TCN1, and TCN2 Identified candidate alterations were confirmed using automated fluorescence dideoxy sequencing.
Co-segregation analysis was performed using each available family member Amplification primers were designed using PrimerZ (Guenther et al.
2009).PCR primers were tagged with established sequencing primers on the 5 end.
Sequencing was performed on an ABI3730 (Life Technologies, Carls- bad, CA) using standard procedures 0 Several months subsequent to exome sequencing, we were notified of the availability of Guthrie blood spot card from the patient and isolated gDNA for genotyping to confirm the presence of identified mutations Results 0 /5 0 the mother, father, and sister Exome sequencing of resulted in an average of 16.7 Gb of sequence per sample (Fig.
1a; Table 1).Mean coverage of captured regions was 141x per sample, with 89% covered with at least 10x coverage and an average of 89% base call quality of Q30 or greater.
Stepwise filtering for the removal of SNPs, intergenic and 3 UTR variants, non-splice-related intronic variants, and synonymous variants resulted in ~111,000 variants per sample (Table 2).
Nonstandard bioinformatics filtering was performed in order to search for gene alterations which may have been transmitted to the deceased neonate but not to his unaffected sister.
Five alterations met these criteria.
Four were within two genes with described autosomal recessive inheritance and the fifth by the mother on the X chromosome.
Of these three genes none related to the patient’s phenotype.
Therefore, all of recessive genes with alterations carried by the father (58) and mother (51) were analyzed for relation to the patient’s phenotype.
Among these, two notable genes (two alterations) with potential clinical relevance were identified: (1) a missense alteration in the MTR gene (c.3518C>T; p.P1173L) present in the mother and (2) a single nucleotide deletion predicting a transla- tional frameshift alteration in the LMBRD1 gene (c.1056delG; p.L352Lfs*18) present in the heterozygous state in the father.
Automated fluorescence dideoxy sequencing using DNA from the infant’s blood spot confirmed the inheritance of each of the two alterations in heterozygous state (Fig.
1b).Furthermore, familial co- segregation analysis revealed that the MTR alteration was absent in the father and sister and the LMBRD1 alteration was absent in the mother and present in the heterozygous state in the sister (Table 3) the autosomal Special consideration was given to the known cobalamin metabolism genes which had almost complete base-pair coverage at 10x (>99%), with exceptions noted in some exons in AMN, CD320, FTDC, MMAB, and HCFC1 (Supplementary Table 1).
No candidate alterations were identified, other than the described MTR and LMBRD1 alterations 32 JIMD Reports JIMD Reports Table 1 HiSeq sequencing run metrics Yield (Gb) Quality % of >¼ Q30 bases (PF) Mean quality score (PF) Base coverage %Base_1x (%) %Base_4x (%) %Base_5x (%) %Base_10x (%) %Base_20x (%) %Base_50x (%) %Base_100x (%) Mean_coverage (%) Father 14.722 88.715 35.115 94.03 91.75 90.72 89.31 85.22 73.65 50.60 121.46 Mother 17.446 88.945 35.195 94.24 92.21 91.31 90.05 86.44 76.95 58.85 148.73 Sister 18.036 88.995 35.205 94.05 92.07 91.18 89.96 86.43 77.26 59.74 153.09 The bold values signify the average of the three individual's (father, mother, sister), values 33 Average 16.735 88.89 35.17 94.11 92.01 91.07 89.77 86.03 75.95 56.40 141.09 Average 110,577 82,465 22,046 11,709 Table 2 Bioinformatics stepwise variant filtering Stepwise filteringa No.

Sanger sequencing using DNA from the infant’s blood spot confirmed the presence of both alterations in compound heterozygous form.
To our knowledge, these results represent both the first example of the molecular diagnosis in the absence of the affected patient as well as the first example of digenic inheritance associated with cobalamin deficiency Mutations in the MTR and LMBRD1 genes have been described in patients with disorders of cobalamin metabolism Specifically, MTR gene alterations are associated with homocystinuria/hyperhomocysteinemia, and LMBRD1 gene alterations are observed in patients with methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria and hyperhomocysteinemia/homocystinuria (Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011).
c.3518C>T (p.P1173L) is the most common alteration observed in the MTR gene, with a frequency of about 40% (16/38 chromosomes) of patients with cblG deficiency (Watkins et al.
2002).LMBRD1 c.1056delG (p.L352Lfs*18) is the most frequently reported alteration, found to be present in 75% (18/24 chromosomes) of one cohort of 12 patients with cblF deficiency (Rutsch et al 2009, 2011) The identified alterations are likely founder mutations among individuals of European ancestry, consistent with the family’s reported ancestry (Watkins et al.
2002; Rutsch et al.
2011).MTR and LMBRD1 are two of the several proteins essential to cobalamin metabolism (reviewed in Sarafoglou and Hoffman 2009; Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011).
MTR is a cobalamin-dependent enzyme that cata- lyzes a methyl transfer reaction from methyltetrahydro- folate to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahyrofolate (Gulati et al.
1997).Mutations in the MTR gene lead to the cblG complementation class of the cobalamin metabolism disorders (Gulati et al.
1996; Watkins et al.
2002).Patients with cblG typically present in the first year of life with elevated homocysteine, decreased methionine, seizures, and cerebral atrophy (Sarafoglou and Hoffman 2009).
Other clinical findings in patients with cblG include decreased S-adenosylmethio- nine, lethargy, feeding difficulties, vomiting, abnormal tonus, mental retardation, failure to thrive, blindness, ataxia, delayed myelination, and megaloblastic anemia (Sarafoglou and Hoffman 2009).
LMBRD1 is a lysosomal membrane protein thought to be involved in lysosomal export of cobalamin in which alteration leads to the cblF comple- mentation class of the cobalamin metabolism disorders (Rutsch et al.
2009, 2011; Gailus et al.2010).
Cells from cblF patients accumulate large amounts of free cobalamin within the lysosomes, but there is a deficiency of both cobalamin coenzyme derivatives and decreased activity of MMA mutase and methionine sythetase (reviewed in Watkins and Rosenblatt, 2011).
Immortalized fibroblasts from patients with cblF show restored cobalamin coenzyme synthesis and function upon transfection with an LMBRD1 wild-type complementary DNA (cDNA) construct (Rutsch et al.
2011).Typical clinical findings in patients with cblF are evident by the first year of life and include increased homocystine and MMA, encephalopathy, poor head growth, decreased cobalamin levels, mental retardation, ataxia, and megaloblastic anemia and/or pancytopenia (Sarafoglou and Hoffman 2009) The proband’s clinical phenotype did not fit any of the well-characterized cobalamin metabolism disorders but had overlapping features.
His elevated homocysteine and low methionine are seen in both cblF and cblG, while the elevated MMA and low cobalamin levels are seen with cblF but not typically with cblG.
He did not have the megaloblastic anemia that is observed in both cblF and JIMD Reports 35 cblG.
However, the phenotype produced from digenic inheritance is often distinct from that observed in either of the contributing genes (e.g., Helwig et al.
1995; Van Goethem et al.
2003; Yang et al.2009).
In fact, a recent review on digenic inheritance cautions medical geneticists to consider digenic inheritance as a possible mechanism for patients with novel phenotypes (Schaffer 2013).
Further, the clinical features observed among patients with LMBRD1 are widely variable (Froese and Gravel 2010; Watkins and Rosenblatt 2011), and specifically patients with the c.1056delG alteration in the compound hetero- zygous or homozygous state show considerable phenotypic variability ranging from death in infancy to asymptomatic long-term survival (Rutsch et al.
2009) The unaffected mother, unaffected father, and unaffected sister do not carry both the MTR and LMBRD1 alterations which would have ruled out the possibility for a digenic affect.
The alterations were present in the compound heterozygous state in the proband, reducing, but not eliminating, the likelihood for copy-number variation (CNV) on the corresponding allele of each gene.
Gross deletions and duplications have not been reported in MTR, but a single report of a 6,785 bp deletion of exon 2 has been reported in LMBRD1 (Miousse et al.
2011).A gross deletion in LMBRD1 would either have occurred de novo in the proband or be inherited from a parent (most likely the mother).
The mother and father’s next-gen sequencing data show comparable coverage within this gene compared with other genes, reducing the likelihood for the presence of deletion within the gene (~120X vs.
mean ¼ 134X  44.4) Due to insufficient DNA isolated from the blood spot of the deceased proband we are unable to entirely exclude this possibility.
Whole- or partial-gene deletions including exon 11 of LMBRD1 or exon 31 or MTR are excluded on the basis of heterozygosity of the mutation call Although a digenic inheritance pattern has not been previously reported in a patient with cobalamin deficiency, it is well described in a growing number of inherited conditions including nonsyndromic hearing loss, Bardet–Biedl syn- drome, retinitis pigmentosa, polycystic kidney disease, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (Vockley 2011; Schaffer 2013).
Common to syndromes in which digenic inheritance has been described are variable expressiv- ity, reduced penetrance, pleiotrpy, and genetic heterogeneity (reviewed in Vockley 2011), all of which are observed in cobalamin deficiency disorders.
The data herein suggest that digenic inheritance may represent a novel molecular mecha- nism for disorders of cobalamin deficiency.
It should be noted, however, that we could not completely rule out an alteration occurring in a dominant de novo manner, a novel gene alteration, or alterations not detectable by exome sequencing (including copy number variation).
Biochemical analysis and in vitro transfection studies are needed to further define the impact of digenic haploinsufficiency on this metabolic pathway.
This unique case highlights the power of whole-exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool even in the absence of a sample from the affected individual and suggests a novel mechanism and inheritance pattern for disorders of cobalamin metabolism Acknowledgments We are grateful to the family of the patient for their participation Compliance with Ethics Guidelines Synopsis In this report, we simultaneously demonstrate the power of new molecular technologies to diagnose a deceased patient while uncovering the first potential example of digenic inheritance associated with cobalamin deficiency Conflict of Interest Kelly Gonzalez, Xiang Li, Hsiao-Mei Lu, Hong Lu, Elizabeth Chao, and Wenqi Zeng are employed and receive a salary from Ambry Genetics.
