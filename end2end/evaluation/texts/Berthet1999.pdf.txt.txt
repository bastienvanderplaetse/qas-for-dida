C-terminal HERG Mutations The Role of Hypokalemia and a KCNQ1-Associated Mutation in Cardiac Event Occurrence Myriam Berthet; Isabelle Denjoy, MD; Claire Donger, MA; Laurence Demay; Hicham Hammoude, MD; Didier Klug, MD; Eric Schulze-Bahr, MD; Pascale Richard, PhD; Harald Funke, MD; Ketty Schwartz, PhD; Philippe Coumel, MD; Bernard Hainque, PhD; Pascale Guicheney, PhD D o w n l o a d e d     f r o m h t t p : / / c i r c  a h a j o u r n a l s  o r g /   b y   g u e s t     o n A p r i l   1 6 ,   2 0 1 8 Background—The long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous disease in which 4 genes encoding ion-channel subunits have been identified.
Most of the mutations have been determined in the transmembrane domains of the cardiac potassium channel genes KCNQ1 and HERG.
In this study, we investigated the 3⬘ part of HERG for mutations Methods and Results—New specific primers allowed the amplification of the 3⬘ part of HERG, the identification of 2 missense mutations, S818L and V822 M, in the putative cyclic nucleotide binding domain, and a 1-bp insertion, 3108⫹1G.
Hypokalemia was a triggering factor for torsade de pointes in 2 of the probands of these families.Lastly, in a large family, a maternally inherited G to A transition was found in the splicing donor consensus site of HERG, 2592⫹1G-A, and a paternally inherited mutation, A341E, was identified in KCNQ1.
The 2 more severely affected sisters bore both mutations Conclusions—The discovery of mutations in the C-terminal part of HERG emphasizes that this region plays a significant role in cardiac repolarization.
Clinical data suggests that these mutations may be less malignant than mutations occurring in the pore region, but they can become clinically significant in cases of hypokalemia.
The first description of 2 patients with double heterozygosity associated with a dramatic malignant phenotype implies that genetic analysis of severely affected young patients should include an investigation for ⬎1 mutation in the LQT genes.

Five loci have been mapped to chromosome 11p15.5 (LQT1), 7q35-36 (LQT2), 3p21-24 (LQT3), 4q25-27 (LQT4), and 21q22-23 (LQT5).1–3 The genes responsible for LQT1, LQT2, and LQT5 have been identified as cardiac potassium channel subunit genes (KVLQT1, HERG, KCNE1),4 – 8 respectively, and for LQT3 as a cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A).9 Mutations in KVLQT1, recently renamed KCNQ1,10 caused half of the LQTS5,11,12 in all the previous cases studied Nevertheless, screening for mutations in KCNQ1 and HERG in large cohorts of probands has led to detection of a percentage lower than that suggested by linkage analyses.2,11 Moreover, only 13 missense mutations in KCNQ1 (out of 191 families) and 5 in HERG (out of 32 families) were identi- fied.13–15 In these studies, only the membrane-spanning do- mains have been investigated.
Thus, the inability to identify the underlying mutations may be owing to many reasons, eg, the presence of a mutation in an unexamined part of the gene and/or failure of the SSCP assay to detect a particular type of mutation Indeed, some mutations have already been identified in the cytoplasmic C-terminal parts of both KCNQ1 and HERG .
In KCNQ1, 2 missense mutations, R539W and R555C, were found in Romano-Ward families, 16,17 in addition to an insertion-deletion in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen patients.18 In HERG, a splicing mutation,4 a missense mutation, V822 M, in the putative nucleotide binding site,19 and a 31-bp dupli- cation were identified in the 3⬘ part of the gene.20 This suggests that the C-terminal parts of these genes should also be analyzed for disease-causing mutations Received July 24, 1998; revision received December 8, 1998; accepted December 8, 1998.
