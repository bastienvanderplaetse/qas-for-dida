The defi- ciency of the sense of smell is related to olfactory bulb hypoplasia or aplasia.
HH is due to GnRH deficiency (2), which likely results from the failed embryonic migration of neuroendocrine GnRH-synthesizing cells (3).
KS is ge- netically heterogeneous.
In 1991 KAL1, encoding an ex- tracellular matrix glycoprotein, was implicated in the X chromosome-linked form of KS (4 – 6).
In 2003 we showed that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene was involved in an autosomal dominant form of KS (7) More recently Falardeau et al.
showed that the gene en- coding fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8, a ligand of FGFR1, was also involved in a few KS cases (8).
Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 gene (CHD7), which underlie coloboma, heart defect, choanal atresia, retardation, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies (CHARGE) syndrome, have also been reported in a few patients initially diagnosed with KS (9, 10) In 2006 we identified, in several KS patients, mutations in PROK2 (National Center for Biotechnology Informa- tion gene ID 60675; Bethesda, MD) or PROKR2 (Na- tional Center for Biotechnology Information gene ID 128674) that encode prokineticin-2 and prokineticin re- ceptor-2 (a G protein-coupled receptor), respectively (11) Since then, we and others reported on the presence of PROKR2 or PROK2 mutations (mainly missense but also nonsense and frameshift mutations) in additional patients (12–16).
Most patients carry monoallelic mutations, but some patients carry mutations on both alleles of either gene.
Moreover, most of the mutations identified in ho- mozygous (or compound heterozygous) patients have also been found in heterozygous state in other patients (11, 12, 15 and this study).
Finally, many of the mutations re- ported so far, whose deleterious effects on the receptor signaling activity are predicted or have been confirmed by in vitro studies (12, 14, 17), are also present in some clin- ically unaffected individuals [(11, 12), and C.
Dodé un- published results)].
This, together with the observation that only homozygous null mice for Prok2 or Prokr2 re- produce the KS phenotype (12, 18) strongly suggests that heterozygous patients carry additional mutations in other KS genes.
Accordingly, we did not find a dominant-neg- ative effect of any of the PROKR2 missense mutations on the wild-type receptor in vitro (17).
Therefore, PROK2 and PROKR2 are likely to be involved both in recessive monogenic and digenic/oligogenic forms of KS (1).
Di- genic inheritance has indeed been shown in a few patients who bear mutations both in PROKR2 and PROK2, KAL1, or FGFR1 (11, 14 and this study).
Notably, a few additional patients have been found to carry mutations in both PROKR2 and the GnRH1, GnRH receptor (GN- RHR), or kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) genes that have been implicated in normosmic congenital HH (19 and this study).
Most patients heterozygous for PROKR2 or PROK2 mutations, however, are expected to carry addi- tional mutations in as-yet-undiscovered KS genes.
Indeed, mutations in the KS genes identified so far have been found in less than 30% of all KS patients, indicating that other disease genes remain to be discovered (1).
Because these genes, when mutated, may cause variable degrees of re- productive and olfactory dysfunction, as well as diverse nonreproductive, nonolfactory anomalies [as previously shown for KAL1, FGFR1, and FGF8 (1)], some clinical heterogeneity can be anticipated among KS patients har- boring monoallelic PROKR2 or PROK2 mutations, de- pending on the other gene(s) implicated in each patient.
In contrast, patients carrying biallelic mutations in PROKR2 or in PROK2, which may be sufficient to cause the KS phenotype as suggested by Prokr2 and Prok2 mouse mu- tants, could have less variable phenotypes.
