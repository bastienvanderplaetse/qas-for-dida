PURPOSE.Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is genetically heteroge- neous with 15 BBS genes currently identiﬁed, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.
The aim of our study was to deﬁne further the spectrum of BBS mutations in a cohort of 44 European-derived American, 8 Tunisian, 1 Arabic, and 2 Paki- stani families (55 families in total) with BBS METHODS.
A total of 142 exons of the ﬁrst 12 BBS-causing genes were screened by dideoxy sequencing.
Cases in which no mutations were found were then screened for BBS13, BBS14, BBS15, RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, NPHP3, TMEM67, and INPP5E RESULTS.
Forty-three mutations, including 8 frameshift muta- tions, 10 nonsense mutations, 4 splice site mutations, 1 dele- tion, and 20 potentially or probably pathogenic missense vari- ations, were identiﬁed in 46 of the 55 families studied (84%) Of these, 21 (2 frameshift mutations, 4 nonsense mutations, 4 splice site mutations, 1 deletion, and 10 missense variations) were novel.
The molecular genetic ﬁndings raised the possibil- ity of triallelic inheritance in 7 Caucasian families, 1 Arabian family, and 1 Tunisian patient.
No mutations were detected for BBS4, BBS11, BBS13, BBS14, BBS15, RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, NPHP3, TMEM67, or INPP5E CONCLUSIONS.
This mutational analysis extends the spectrum of known BBS mutations.
Identiﬁcation of 21 novel mutations highlights the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder.
Differ- ences in European and Tunisian patients, including the high frequency of the M390R mutation in Europeans, emphasize the population speciﬁcity of BBS mutations with potential diagnos- tic implications.

(Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.2011; 52:5317–5324) DOI:10.1167/iovs.11-7554 B ardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS; MIM 209900) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, truncal obesity, cognitive impairment, polydactyly, hypogonadism, and renal anoma- lies.1– 6 Among the nonconsanguineous populations of North- ern Europe and America, the prevalence ranges from 1 in 100,000 in North America7 to 1 in 160,000 in Switzerland.8 BBS incidence increases within populations of high consanguinity or those that are geographically isolated.4,9,10 To date, 15 genes (BBS112, Meckel syndrome 1 [MKS1, BBS13], centro- somal protein 290 kDa/nephronophthisis 6 [CEP290/NPHP6, BBS14], and C2ORF86 [BBS15]) have been implicated in BBS.11,12 Mutations in these genes account only for approxi- mately 70% of BBS patients, suggesting that there are additional genes to be found for BBS.13BBS1 and BBS10 are major patho- genic genes in European populations, each accounting for at least 20% of cases in most series.14,15 However, most other genes are rare contributors.
For example, there is only a single documented family with mutations in each of BBS11 (TRIM32), BBS13 (MKS1), BBS14 (CEP290), and BBS15 (C2ORF86).12,16,17 A number of recent publications have expanded the spectrum of known BBS mutations,18 –21 and suggested that mutations in some genes, including BBS13 and TMEM67/MKS3, can modify the expression of BBS phenotypes in patients who have mutations in other genes BBS is also characterized by profound interfamilial and in- trafamilial clinical variability, which is possibly explained in part by the presence of second-site modiﬁers.
In some families, three mutated alleles in two BBS genes have been implicated (triallelic inheritance).
BBS1, BBS2, BBS3, BBS4, BBS5, BBS6, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS10 have been implicated in triallelic inheritance of BBS,22–25 but the speciﬁc contribution of each allele is difﬁcult to ascertain.
Moreover, it has been suggested that there might be a connection between triallelism and the phenotypic severity of the disease.26 However, some studies have not identiﬁed a complex inheritance mode in this syn- drome.27,28 In this study, we analyzed 55 families for known BBS genes (BBS1-BBS15) and identiﬁed 43 mutations in 46 families, 21 of which are novel.
We also identiﬁed 7 Caucasian, 1 Arabic, and 1 Tunisian family in whom the molecular genetic ﬁndings raised the possibility of triallelic inheritance involving BBS1, BBS2, BBS3, BBS6, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, BBS10, or BBS12 Although some sequence variations were identiﬁed in addi- tional genes, no homozygous potential mutations were identi- ﬁed in previously unidentiﬁed BBS genes 5317 Downloaded From: http://iovs.arvojournals.org/ on 04/16/20185318 Chen et al MATERIALS AND METHODS Appropriate informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study, in accord with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
This study was approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Inﬁrmary and Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Boards, the ethics review board of Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, and the CNS Institutional Review Board at the National Institutes of Health Study Subjects We studied 70 persons with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) from 55 unrelated families including 8 recruited in Tunisia, 2 recruited in Pakistan, and 44 of European and 1 of Arabian descent recruited in the United States.
In this study, the 8 BBS families recruited from Tunisia did not overlap with participants from a previous study.28 Among the 55 families, 44 were sporadic cases and the remaining had at least 2 affected members.
BBS was diagnosed on the basis of the established criterion that 4 primary features or 3 primary plus 2 secondary features are necessary to make the diagnosis.29 The control group consisted of 96 persons of European origin, 96 persons of Tunisian origin, and 96 persons of Pakistani origin Mutation Screening We carried out a mutation screen of the ﬁrst 12 identiﬁed BBS (BBS1- BBS12) genes in 55 families (for a total of 70 patients) collected from the United States, Tunisia, and Pakistan.
For BBS1 to BBS12, all genes were screened in all cases.
Cases in which no mutations were found in BBS1 to BBS12 were then screened for mutations in BBS13 (MKS1), BBS14 (CEP290, NPHP6), and BBS15 (C2ORF86) as well as in RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, NPHP3, TMEM67, and INPP5E because they have been implicated in other ciliopathies.
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes using standard protocols.30 Coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the 20 genes were ampliﬁed by PCR using standard methods.
Ampliﬁcations were carried out as previously de- scribed,28 and the PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels and puriﬁed by vacuum ﬁltration manifold plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) The PCR primers for each exon were used for bidirectional sequencing using a reaction mix (BigDye Terminator Ready; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Se- quencing was performed on a gene analyzer (ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems), and sequence traces were analyzed (MutationSurveyor [Soft Genetics Inc., State College, PA] and the SeqMan program of DNASTAR Software [DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI]) Criteria to Determine the Pathogenicity of New BBS Mutations A mutation was considered novel if it was not present in the Human Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/index.html) and not published A sequence variation was considered pathogenic when it segregated with the disease in the family and, when parental origin could be determined, double heterozygous mutations acted in trans; it was not present in 96 randomly selected controls from the ethnically matched population; it altered a well-conserved amino acid, preferably in a conserved region (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html); and it was judged signiﬁcant in a computational test for novel muta- tions.
The neural network splice site scoring program (http://www fruitﬂy.org/seq_tools/splice.html) was used to evaluate the effect of mutations affecting splice sites.
Splice site scores were calculated with Splice site Score Calculation software (http://rulai.cshl.edu/new_ alt_exon_db2/HTML/score.html).
PolyPhen analysis (http://genetics bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) was used to predict whether missense varia- tions could impact the protein structure and function.
The prediction is based on the position-speciﬁc independent counts score derived from a combination of available structural information and multiple IOVS, July 2011, Vol.
52, No.8 sequence alignments of observations.
PolyPhen scores ⬎2.0 indicate the variant is probably damaging to protein function; scores from 1.5 to 2.0 indicate the variant is possibly damaging; and scores ⬍1.5 indicate the variant is Likely benign.
In the present study, both “prob- ably damaging” and “possibly damaging” changes were classiﬁed as suspected pathogenic mutations RESULTS General Overview of BBS Mutations Mutations were detected in 46 (of 55; 84%) families, and no mutations were detected for the remaining 9 (of 55; 16%) families.
We identiﬁed 43 different mutations in the 46 families, including 39 families from the United States, includ- ing 1 of Saudi Arabian derivation, 5 from Tunisia, and 2 from Pakistan.
Of the 43 different mutations, 21 were novel (Fig.
1, Table 113–15,24 –26,28,31–34), conﬁrming the genetic heterogeneity of BBS.
Seven Caucasian, 1 Arabian, and 1 Tunisian family (20% of families with mutations detected) carry 3 mutations in 2 different genes, raising the possibility of triallelic inheritance (Table 1).
Thirty-seven families (83% of patients with mutations detected) carry only 2 mutations in the same gene (Table 1): 15 for BBS1 (13 homozygotes and 2 compound heterozygotes), 4 for BBS2 (3 homozy- gotes and 1 compound heterozygote), 2 homozygotes for BBS3, 2 homozygotes for BBS5, 3 homozygotes for BBS7, 11 for BBS10 (5 homozygotes and 6 compound heterozygotes), and 1 compound heterozygote for BBS12 (C4ORF24).
None of the novel mutations or third-allele mutations was ob- served in 192 ethnically matched control chromosomes, and none is recorded in the dbSNP database BBS1 Mutations BBS1 mutations were present in 19 of the 46 families with identiﬁed mutations and represented the primary pathogenic locus in 18 families (33%) and a possible third mutant allele in 1 family (Fig.
1, Table 1).In 15 families (13 homozygotes and 2 compound heterozygotes), only 2 mutations were identiﬁed in the BBS1 gene (Table 1).
Eighteen affected members of 12 Caucasian families and 1 Tunisian family were homozygous for the M390R allele, predicted to be pathogenic with a PolyPhen score of 2.7.
The proband of family D597 is a compound heterozygote for M390R and c.518⫹1G⬎A, which was not found in controls and showed calculated splice site scores of 11.0 for the normal splice site and 0.2 for the variant site, suggesting that it affects splicing.
The proband of family 7348 was a compound heterozygote for the M390R and E549X alleles.
All affected members carrying the M390R mutation shared a common SNP haplotype across the BBS1 gene (Sup- plementary Table S1, http://www.iovs.org/lookup/suppl/doi: 10.1167/iovs.11-7554/-/DCSupplemental) Possible triallelic inheritance with involvement of muta- tions at two distinct loci was seen in 3 European-American families (K550, J118, and E521) and 1 Tunisian family (057015) (Table 1), including the proband of family 057015, who was heterozygous for the F337L allele in BBS8 and homozygous for the c.1473⫹4A⬎G BBS1 allele, which showed a reduction from 7.3 for the natural splice site to 4.3 for the variant site, indicating that this alteration might affect splicing BBS2 Mutations BBS2 mutations were identiﬁed in 6 of the 46 families; they were the primary pathogenic mutations in 5 families (9%) and a potential triallelic contributor in 1 family.
Two were novel (Fig.
