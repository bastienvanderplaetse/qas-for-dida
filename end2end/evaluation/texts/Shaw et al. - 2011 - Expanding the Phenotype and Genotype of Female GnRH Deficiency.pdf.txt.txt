Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/96/3/E566/2597492 by ULB user on 16 April 2018 J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2011, 96(3):E566 –E576 jcem.endojournals.org E567 Isolated GnRH deficiency is a disorder of hypogonadism attributable to low or inappropriately normal gonad- otropins resulting in absent or incomplete puberty, often seen in association with nonreproductive phenotypes such as craniofacial, skeletal, neurologic, renal, and olfactory abnormalities (1).
The olfactory phenotype has tradition- ally been used to subdivide these patients into normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH) and anosmic 关Kallmann’s syndrome (KS)兴 variants.
Although females with GnRH deficiency were included in Kall- mann’s original report of the familial nature of this dis- order, men have been the focus of much of the subsequent scientific literature because of the significant excess of males to females reported with this condition (1) Rare sequence variants (RSVs) in genes involved in GnRH neuronal migration (FGF8, FGFR1, KAL1, PROK2, PROKR2, and NELF), secretion (GNRH1, GPR54, TAC3, and TACR3) and receptivity (GNRHR) have been reported to contribute to GnRH deficiency in both men and women (reviewed in Ref.
1), although the relative frequency of the RSVs in each gene has not been investigated in a large female cohort.
An important exception is the X-linked gene, KAL1, inwhichRSVshaveonlybeenfoundinGnRH-deficientmen However, because of the assumption that female GnRH de- ficiency could not be explained by a RSV in a gene associated with an X-linked recessive disorder and the absence of a reproductive phenotype in a small number of obligate KAL1 female carriers (2–4), there are fewer than 100 published cases in which KAL1 has been screened in GnRH-deficient women (3–6) Systematic clinical investigation has broadened the phenotype of male GnRH deficiency to include not only severe congenital hypogonadism but also late pubertal ar- rest (7), adult-onset disease (8), and even adult reversal (9) Recent genetic studies of male probands and their fam- ilies suggest that a broader phenotypic spectrum may also exist in women (10 –13), but this hypothesis has not been addressed systematically Through detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiling of a large cohort of females with isolated GnRH defi- ciency, the current study demonstrates a clinical spectrum in both breast development and menses.
It also reveals the relative frequency of RSVs in the genes implicated in nor- mal GnRH function, including the unexpected finding of KAL1 RSVs in 6.2% of this entirely female cohort Subjects and Methods Patient population The cohort comprised 248 females referred to an academic medical center for presumed isolated GnRH deficiency between 1980 and 2010.
Ninety-six were patients of physicians in the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/96/3/E566/2597492 by ULB user on 16 April 2018 Reproductive Endocrine Unit (REU) of Massachusetts General Hospital.
The remainder were self-referred or referred by phy- sicians from around the world in response to a clinical trial posting and completed testing by mail (questionnaire, smell testing, blood samples for DNA isolation).
All women were ⱖ16 yr old at the time of evaluation, had low estradiol (E2) levels in the face of low or inappropriately normal gonado- tropins, no other pituitary hormone deficiencies, and no neu- roanatomic or functional cause of hypogonadotropic hypo- gonadism.
None of the women had a known eating disorder, each had achieved the minimum weight for height necessary for the onset of menstrual cycles (14), and none exercised excessively 关defined as greater than 20 miles per week of run- ning or its equivalent (15)兴 Both phenotypic and genotypic information was available in 207 women, of whom 62 had baseline neuroendocrine sampling The majority (61%) was tested for all 11 genes, while 85% were tested for ⱖ5 genes.
The remaining women had detailed pheno- typic information, but either DNA was not available or they were not included in RSV frequency calculations because they were female relatives of the proband who harbored the same RSV Complete DNA sequencing of the 11 genes was performed in 80 –160 or 200 –350 alleles from female or male controls, re- spectively, who had normal reproductive function by history and physical examination.
Each KAL1 RSV identified in GnRH-de- ficient women was tested in 870 X-chromosomes (from male and female controls) This study was approved by the Massachusetts General Hos- pital Human Research Committee, and signed informed consent was obtained from each subject before participation Phenotyping Clinical assessment A detailed questionnaire was administered to all subjects to assess family history, ethnicity, height, weight, eating attitudes and behaviors, dysmorphic features, pubertal development, and results of brain imaging.
Categorization of anosmia was based on history alone or on the results of olfactory testing (40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) (16).
For statistical purposes, women scoring ⱖ5th% based on age were coded as normosmic and all others were coded as anosmic.
Ovar- ian volumes were determined by transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound and calculated with the formula for an ellipse (V ⫽ 0.52 ⫻ maximal longitudinal ⫻ antero-posterior ⫻ transverse diameters) Neuroendocrine evaluation Hormone replacement was discontinued for at least one month before initial REU evaluation.
Frequent blood sampling (every 10 min overnight for 12 h) was performed to assess en- dogenous GnRH secretion as manifested by LH pulsatility.
FSH and E2 were assayed from pools from these frequent sampling studies.
Pulsatile LH was analyzed using a validated modifica- tion of the Santen and Bardin method (17, 18).
Results were compared with those previously reported for 17 normally cycling women studied during the early follicular phase (EFP) of an ovu- latory cycle (19, 20).
Women with GnRH deficiency were clas- sified as having low amplitude or low frequency LH pulse pat- terns if their levels were more than two SD’s below the normal range 关LH amplitude 2.3 ⫾ 1.0, frequency 7 ⫾ 1.8 pulses per E568 Shaw et al Phenotype and Genotype of Female GnRH Deficiency J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2011, 96(3):E566 –E576 12-hour (mean ⫾ SD)兴.
Women whose pulse frequency and am- plitude were indistinguishable from controls were further eval- uated for a pattern of sleep augmentation, as previously de- scribed (21) Detection of DNA sequence variants Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples by standard phenol-chloroform extraction.
Exonic and proxi- mal intronic (ⱕ15 bp from splice sites) DNA sequences of 11 genes implicated in the etiology of GnRH deficiency were am- plified by PCR and determined by direct sequencing.
These genes include KAL1 (anosmin-1, OMIM 308700), GNRH1 (gonad- otropin-releasing hormone 1, OMIM 152760) GNRHR (GnRH receptor, OMIM 138850), GPR54 (KISS1 receptor, OMIM 604161), NELF (nasal embryonic LHRH factor, OMIM 608137), FGF8 (fibroblast growth factor 8, OMIM 600483), FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, OMIM 136350), PROK2 (prokineticin 2, OMIM 607002), PROKR2 (prokine- ticin receptor 2, OMIM 607212), TAC3 (tachykinin 3, OMIM 162330), and TACR3 (tachykinin receptor 3, OMIM 162332) One KS woman with features of CHARGE syndrome was also tested for CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7, OMIM 608892).
PCR primers and amplification conditions for each gene have been described previously (3, 22–30).
All sequence variations were observed on both DNA strands and were confirmed in a separate PCR.
Homozygosity for the KAL1 Q131H variant was confirmed by multiplex ligation-depen- dent probe amplification (MLPA, MRC-Holland, The Neth- erlands).
Genes and proteins are described using standard no- menclature (31).
Presentation of results is restricted to sequence variants that were 1) at splice junctions within 5 bp of coding sequence, or 2) in coding sequence and nonsynonymous; and 3) present in ⬍1% of control alleles.
Rare synonymous changes were also compared between cases and controls for in- ternal validation Functional analysis The in vitro functional data reported has been previously described (10, 12, 23–26, 30, 32–36).
Where in vitro data were not available, five different prediction programs were used to determine the potential significance of missense variants and one prediction program was used for intronic changes.
These included PolyPhen (37), Mutation Taster (38), Panther (39), SIFT (40), pMUT (41), and Human Splicing Finder (42).
In vitro data and prediction program results are presented in Supplemental Table 1 (published on The Endocrine Society’s Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org/) Mode of inheritance Phenotypic characterizations of the proband and family members were used to determine the mode of inheritance as previously described (7).
No families in this cohort met the def- inition of X-linked recessive or X-linked dominant inheritance, although the latter could not always be distinguished from au- tosomal dominant inheritance (i.e., in cases of small pedigrees with transmission of the trait through the female).
A family was classified as sporadic if no other relatives were affected and as unknown if no pedigree information was available Assays Serum LH and FSH were measured using a two-site monoclonal nonisotopic system (Axsym; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) as previously described (43–46), and expressed in international units per liter (IU/liter) of the Pituitary 2nd International Standard 80/552.
Estradiol was measured by two different RIAs using highly specific antisera with a functional sensitivity of ⱕ20 pg/ml (73.4 pmol/liter) which were cross-referenced (47, 48) Statistical methods Data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SE unless otherwise indi- cated.
Because of the association of a more severe reproductive phenotype with anosmia in men with GnRH deficiency, com- parisons were performed between nIHH and KS women using independent samples t tests (for parametric data) and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests (for nonparametric data) for continuous vari- ables.
␹2 or Fischer’s exact test were used as tests of association and to compare categorical variables between nIHH and KS women.
A P value of ⬍0.05 was considered to be statistically significant Results Phenotype studies Clinical presentation The clinical and biochemical features of the 248 women are summarized in Table 1.
Forty-seven percent of women were anosmic.
As the women presented for evaluation at a relatively advanced age (mean 28.5 yr), nearly all had undergone at least some treatment with hormone replace- ment before presentation.
However, before hormone re- placement, 88% had undergone normal pubarche, 51% had some degree of breast development, and 10% had one or two spontaneous menses with no difference noted between nIHH and KS women.
Women with thelarche were more likely to demonstrate pubarche than those without (97% vs.
77%, P ⫽ 0.04) but did not have higher FSH (P ⫽ 0.3) or E2 levels (P ⫽ 0.09), or larger ovarian volumes (P ⫽ 0.6) Neuroendocrine and ultrasonographic studies E2 levels were low, nearly all being undetectable 关⬍20 pg/ml (⬍73.4 pmol/liter)兴, with normal to low gonado- tropins (Table 1).
Mean ovarian volumes were smaller than in normal adult women 关mean 9.5 cc; 95% confi- dence interval (3.9 –15.9 cc)兴 (49), and nIHH women had larger ovarian volumes than KS women (P ⫽ 0.02) with a tendency for higher gonadotropin levels (Table 1).
Nor- mosmic and KS women had similar patterns of LH secre- tion with the majority (75 and 70%, respectively) having an apulsatile pattern (Fig.
1A) and a smaller number dem- onstrating a low amplitude and/or low frequency pattern In 8% of women (n ⫽ 6), the mean frequency and ampli- tude of LH pulses was within 2 SD of the EFP mean in normal women.
Two of these women with evidence of pulsatile GnRH release exhibited a pattern of sleep aug- mentation that is characteristic of children in early puberty Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/96/3/E566/2597492 by ULB user on 16 April 2018 J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2011, 96(3):E566 –E576 jcem.endojournals.org E569 TABLE 1.

The overall group of women with evi- dence of some underlying GnRH secretion was no more likely to have experienced thelarche or menarche than women without LH pulses (P ⫽ 0.8 and P ⫽ 0.07, respec- tively).
Women with menses (n ⫽ 10) were also not dif- ferent from the overall cohort in terms of reproductive and nonreproductive phenotypes, body mass index, age, or LH secretory pattern Genetic studies Detailed family histories were available in 148 women, revealing a familial pattern of GnRH deficiency in 66% (64% autosomal dominant, 36% autosomal recessive, 0% X-linked).
Normosmic IHH cases were more likely to be familial (and autosomal recessive), whereas KS cases were more likely to be sporadic (P ⬍ 0.005; Supplemental Table 2) Thirty-six percent of GnRH-deficient women har- bored at least one RSV in a gene known to be associated with GnRH deficiency.
This was significantly more than in control men and women (14%; P ⬍ 0.001) and sug- gests that most of the RSVs detected confer susceptibil- ity to the GnRH deficiency phenotype.
This difference was in large part attributable to an increased frequency of RSVs in FGFR1, GNRHR, PROKR2, and KAL1 in GnRH-deficient women compared with controls (Sup- plemental Table 3).
As expected, the frequency of rare synonymous variants was not different between GnRH- deficient women and controls (8% and 12%, respec- tively, P ⫽ 0.1) E570 Shaw et al Phenotype and Genotype of Female GnRH Deficiency J Clin Endocrinol Metab, March 2011, 96(3):E566 –E576 TABLE 2.
