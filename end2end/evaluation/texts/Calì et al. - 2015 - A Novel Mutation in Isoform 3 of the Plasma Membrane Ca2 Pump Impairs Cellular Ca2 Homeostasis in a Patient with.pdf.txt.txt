results thus confirmed that the introduction of R482H muta- tion in both a and b pump variants impaired their efficiency in maintaining basal Ca2⫹ levels, causing sustained Ca2⫹ retention in the cytoplasm Effect of the R482H Mutation on the Basal Activity of PMCA3 Assessed by Functional Complementation Assay in K616 Yeast Cells—To better evaluate the effect of the R482H mutation on pump basal activity, i.e.
on the activity of the auto-inhibited state of the pump only exposed to the nM concentration of Ca2⫹ that prevails in the cytoplasm at rest, a yeast-based functional assay, which has been previously described, was employed (23) In this assay, the lethal phenotype of the K616 triple mutant FIGURE 2.

***, p ⬍ 0.001; ns, not significant yeast cells observed in Ca2⫹-free conditions can be rescued by the ectopic expression of active Ca2⫹ pumps.
To test the sys- tem, two control PMCA3 mutants were generated: an ATPase- dead mutant in which the catalytic aspartate residue of the pump was replaced with an alanine (PMCA3b D465A), and a C-terminally truncated PMCA3 mutant lacking nearly the entire autoinhibitory C-terminal tail (the last 158 C-terminal residues, PMCA3-⌬Cter).
The removal of the C-terminal tail renders the pump constitutively active, making this variant a suitable positive control in the assay Yeast K616 cells were transformed with the galactose-induc- ible plasmid pYES encoding the wt pump, or with the PMCA3b D465A, the PMCA3-⌬Cter, and the PMCA3b R482H pump variants.
Fig.4A shows the growth controls of yeast trans- formed with the different PMCA3 constructs in a Ca2⫹-con- taining permissive medium (glucose ⫹ CaCl2) or in an induci- ble Ca2⫹-free medium (galactose ⫹ EGTA), and Fig.
4B shows the Western blotting analysis of the PMCA3 pump protein expression levels As expected, the PMCA3b-⌬Cter mutant that lacked the C-terminal tail, and was thus constitutively active, was able to fully rescue the viability of K616 yeast cells in the Ca2⫹-de- pleted medium, whereas the wt PMCA3b, which was auto-in- hibited, did it only partially (Fig.
4A).Again as expected, the ATPase-dead PMCA3b D465A mutant failed to rescue the via- bility of the K616 yeast cells (Fig.
4A).Fig.
4C shows the effect of the PMCA3b R482H mutant in comparison with the wt and the constitutively active PMCA3b-⌬Cter variant.
The R482H mutant was clearly defective in the recovery of the viability of the K616 cells.
The mutant pump did still permit some recovery of yeast viability, i.e.
it evidently did not completely turn off the basal, unstimulated activity of the pump.
This was in agree- ment with the results of the experiments on the overexpres- sion of the mutated pump in HeLa cells that had shown that the R482H PMCA3 mutant, even if defective, was still active The Western blot analysis of the total protein extracts from yeast cells grown in the galactose medium show that all PMCA3 constructs were expressed in yeast cells at compa- rable levels (Fig.
4, B and D for the different PMCA3b vari- ants).
The experiments in Fig.4 thus shows that the defect induced by the R482H mutation also affected the basal unstimulated activity of the pump In Silico Analysis of the Effects of the R482H Mutation on PMCA3 Pump Structure—In an attempt to understand the con- sequences of the R482H mutation on the structure of the pump, we decided to perform an in silico modeling study using the SERCA pump 3D structure in the Ca2⫹-free and Ca2⫹-bound states (PDB ID:3W5B) and (PDB ID: 1SU4) (Fig.
5, A and D, respectively).
The 3D structure defines the membrane sector of the pump containing 10 helices, and the three large cytosolic domains: the ATP binding N domain protruding into the cyto- sol between trans-membrane domains 4 and 5, the P domain that contains the catalytic Asp (blue dots), and the A domain (the actuator domain) that performs the de-phosphorylation of the catalytic Asp-P.
During the reaction cycle, a series of con- formational transformations have been shown to occur in both the cytosolic and the membrane sectors of the SERCA pump, the most evident being the transition of the cytosolic portion from a compact arrangement in the Ca2⫹-free state (Fig.
5A) to a looser state in its presence (Fig.
5D).A finer analysis of the structure of the modeled PMCA3 pump identifies glutamate 530 as critical for short-range interactions with the Arg-482 16138 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 290 • NUMBER 26 • JUNE 26, 2015 D o w n l o a d e d     f r o m h t t p : / / w w w  j b c  o r g /   a t     U L B o n A p r i l     1 6 ,   2 0 1 8 PMCA3 Mutation and Cerebellar Ataxia D o w n l o a d e d     f r o m h t t p : / / w w w  j b c  o r g /   a t     U L B o n A p r i l     1 6 ,   2 0 1 8 FIGURE 4.

Empty vector pYES2 (mock transfected) was used as negative control.
C and D, same as A-B but yeast K616 cells are transformed with pYES2-derived vectors carrying wild-type, R482H mutant, or the PMCA⌬3Cter.
Total protein lysates from yeast cells carrying the indicated pYES2-derived plasmids were probed with anti-PMCA antibody 5F10.Both mono- meric (*) and dimeric (**) PMCA3 forms were detected residue.
In the wt PMCA3 pump in the Ca2⫹-free state, Arg- 482 is at a distance of 9.2 Å from Glu-530 (Fig.
5B), the distance increasing to 11.6 Å if the position 482 is occupied by a histidine (Fig.
5C).These distances obviously do not permit the interac- tion between the two residues.
However, in the Ca2⫹-bound state (Fig.
5, E and F), the guanidinium nitrogens of Arg-482 are now at a distance from both carboxylic oxygens of Glu-530 that permits interaction: 2.66 Å for each of them (Fig.
5E).The inter- action could be critical for the stabilization of this portion of the PMCA3 pump in the Ca2⫹-bound state.
However, when posi- tion 482 becomes occupied by a histidine (Fig.
5F), its nitrogen lies at a distance of 4.5 Å and 4.3 Å from the oxygens of Glu-530, respectively.
These increased distances could well reduce the stabilization of this portion of the pump in the Ca2⫹-bound state.
The intrinsic pH-dependence of histidine might also have a role in the modulation of the stability of this portion of the pump molecule could perhaps be specifically associated to the ataxic pathology A peculiar property of PMCA pumps is the phenomenon of auto-inhibition in the resting, low Ca2⫹ state.
It is produced by the binding of the C-terminal tail of the pump to its main body, and is relieved by the binding of calmodulin once Ca2⫹ in the ambient increases.
Thus, mutations could positively or nega- tively affect the auto-inhibition process and/or inhibit the Ca2⫹ exporting function of the pump in the fully active state (24, 25) It should also be mentioned that the Ca2⫹ exporting function of the pump in cells in which the much more powerful Na⫹/Ca2⫹ exchanger predominates, e.g.
in muscles and neurons, is of mar- ginal importance to the global regulation of cell Ca2⫹ (26), but is very important to the regulation of Ca2⫹ in the microdomains surrounding the cytosolic portion of the pump.
The PMCA pump has been shown to be concentrated in the caveolae, which also contain enzyme supercomplexes that are essential for cell functions (27, 28).
Neurons do not contain caveolae, but contain functionally equivalent structural microdomains, e.g the spines.
Pump defects could thus have important conse- quences for the local regulation of intracellular Ca2⫹ signaling with very serious deleterious effects on the activity of the cell One last important point should be mentioned, as it may be significant to the role of PMCA pump defects in pathology.
As it has become clear from the studies of hereditary hearing loss, the mutation in the ATP2B2 gene acted synergistically with a defect of CDH23 or MYO6 to induce the pathological pheno- type by a digenic disease-causing mechanism.
In the proband described here, the defect of the PMCA3 pump is not isolated, as he also carries compound heterozygous mutations in LAMA1.
Interestingly, his maternal grandfather carries the PMCA3 mutation and is apparently healthy, which raises ques- tions regarding incomplete penetrance secondary to genetic modifiers.
We suggest that the PMCA3 mutation, may contrib- ute or enhance ataxic symptoms in the presence of the two LAMA1 mutations in our proband.
Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins essential for basement membranes assembly Discussion Genetic defects of calcium pumps (the Golgi (SPCA) pump, the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SERCA) pump, and the plasma membrane (PMCA) pump) are the cause of a number of diseases.
The hereditary deafness caused by mutations of the PMCA2 isoform (7, 9) can be associated with ataxic symptoms (10, 11).
An ataxia-causing defect was recently described in PMCA3 (12).
The present contribution describes a second case of ataxia in which the proband carries a defect in the PMCA3 pump.
The defect was evident in both the maximally activated Ca2⫹ exporting function of the pump and in its resting activity, in which the pump was expected to be largely auto-inhibited The overall malfunction of the enzyme in both the fully active and in the resting states was not surprising, as the mutation concerned a residue close to its active center.
The in silico anal- ysis shown in Fig.
5 has offered a plausible molecular rationale for the inhibitory effect of the mutation The finding of a second ataxic proband who carries an ATP2B3 mutation suggests that defects of the PMCA3 pump JUNE 26, 2015 • VOLUME 290 • NUMBER 26 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 16139 PMCA3 Mutation and Cerebellar Ataxia D o w n l o a d e d     f r o m h t t p : / / w w w  j b c  o r g /   a t     U L B o n A p r i l     FIGURE 5.
Structural changes induced by the R482H mutation in the PMCA3 pump.A, Ca2⫹-free and D, Ca2⫹-bound structures of the wt (B and E) and R482H-mutated (C and F) PMCA3 pumps were built on the basis of the respective SERCA structures (PDB 3W5B and 1SU4, respectively).
The blue dots represent the catalytic aspartate and the Arg-482 and the His-482 residues are shown as stick together with the Glu-530 residue.
The N terminus and the C terminus of the pump are shown as orange and cyan dots, respectively 1 6 ,   2 0 1 8 (29), and LAMA1 is essential for mouse cerebellar develop- ment: its deficiency causes a decrease in the proliferation and migration of granule cells precursors and a marked reduction of dendritic processes in Purkinje cells (30).
Mutations in PMCA3 and LAMA1 could thus work synergistically, and contribute to the disease phenotype of our proband.
This is still a speculative suggestion since it cannot be excluded that the two LAMA1 mutations would be sufficient per se to cause the phenotype The malfunction of the systems that control Ca2⫹ could natu- rally be expected to have negative consequences for neurons, given the special importance of Ca2⫹ signaling to them.
How- ever, the synergism between a defect of LAMA1 and that of a Ca2⫹-related protein is not as immediately obvious as that of the PMCA2 pump with Ca2⫹-related Cadherin-23 in heredi- tary deafness.
It might be interesting that another laminin, ␤-2 laminin, has recently been shown to be involved in the process of maturation and Ca2⫹ sensitivity of voltage-gated Ca2⫹ chan- nels (31) Acknowledgments—Ethics Statement: The parents of the proband signed a Media Authorization for the Use and Disclosure Protected Health Information form approved by The Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
