ples for diagnostic purposes.The Institutional Ethics Committee approved (18 July 2016) the Italian Alport Registry (Reg-I-AS).
For each subject, pedigrees were constructed and clinical data were collected regard- ing kidney function (hematuria, proteinuria, chronic renal failure or ESRD) and extrarenal manifestations (high-tone sensorineural hearing loss and ocular lesions) Detailed data on microscopic examination of kidney biopsies were also collected when available.
A sample of peripheral blood in EDTA tubes was collected from probands and all available family members (18 subjects) Samples and DNA extraction Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA peripheral blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood Kit accord- ing to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
The DNA samples, with patients’ informed consent, were stored in the institutional Telethon biobank (http://biobanknetwork.telethon.it/) Custom panel design In order to perform mutational screening of patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of ATS, we created a custom panel for COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes using the ‘Ion AmpliSeq™ designer’ software (www .ampliseq.com).
We targeted the coding region and all the flanking introns up to 25 bp.
The 5′ and 3′ UTR were not included in the panel design.
The total coverage of the panel for the three genes was 98.33% and it consisted of 35 Fallerini et al two different PCR primers pools containing 98 and 96 amplicons for a total of 184 amplicons Ion torrent PGM sequencing The library preparation was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Kit 2.0 (Life Technologies, Carls- bad, CA).
This kit allowed obtaining a barcoded library of the 184 amplicons, corresponding to the 151 exons of COL4A3/COL4A4/COL4A5 genes compatible with the Ion PGM platform, according to the Life Technologies protocol (http://ioncommunity.lifetechnologies.com/ community/login.jspa?referer=http://ioncommunity .lifetechnologies.com/community/protocols-home) Libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP system and quantified using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Life Tech- nologies), pooled at an equimolar ratio, annealed to carrier spheres (Ion Sphere™ Particles, Life Technolo- gies) and clonally amplified by emulsion PCR (emPCR) using the Ion OneTouch™ 2 system (Ion PGM™ Tem- plate OT2 200 kit, Life Technologies).
The spheres, carrying single stranded DNA templates, were loaded to Ion 314™, 316™ or 318™ chip and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM, using the Ion PGM™ Sequencing 200 kit v2, according to the protocol of Life Technolo- gies.
Post-run analysis was conducted using the latest version (v5.0.2) of the data analysis software Torrent Suite™ (Life Technologies).
Coverage assessment was performed using the ‘coverageAnalysis’ plug-in (v5.0.2) that gives information about the amplicon read coverage and variants were called using the ‘variantCaller’ plug-in (5.0.2) Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis Variant validation and segregation analysis in DNA of all available family members were performed by direct Sanger sequencing.
Sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems by ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, Stati Uniti) and data were analyzed by Sequencher software V.4.9 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI).
Genotypes of pedigrees were examined to determine the pattern of inheritance of the variants identified and to assess genotype–phenotype correlations Variant interpretation Aggregation Bioinformatic analysis Identified variants were checked in the datasets of the following online databases: NCBI dbSNP Build 142 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), ExAC (Exome http://exac .broadinstitute.org/) and 1000 genomes (http://www .1000genomes.org).
Our in-house data set containing exome data of 80 Italian individuals was also con- sulted.
In order to check whether variants have been already reported in ATS we consulted literature and the specific COL4A5 mutation database (http://www.arup Consortium; 36 .utah.edu/database/ALPORT/ALPORT_display.php? sort=2#alport; Last update: October 2013) (26).
In silico evaluation of variants pathogenicity was performed using Alamut software v2.3 (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) which includes the following prediction tools: Align GVGD, SIFT, MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2, SpliceSiteFinder-like, MaxEntScan, NNSPLICE, Gene- Splicer, Human Splicing Finder, and ESE Finder Minigene assay for intronic variants To obtain the hybrid minigene constructs, we employed as backbone the β-globin-pCDNA3.1 vector harbor- ing an artificial multiple cloning site (containing the XhoI, NotI and HindIII sites) as previously reported (27).
We amplified by PCR a portion of each gene containing the variant of interest (c.780+5G>A in COL4A5, c.931-2A>G and c.976-56A>G in COL4A4) from genomic DNA of the patients.
Primers carried the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites to enable the subsequent cloning in the β-globin-pCDNA3.1 vector (oligonucleotides and PCR conditions are available upon request).
For the c.780+5G>A variant in intron 13 of the COL4A5 gene, we obtained a 586 bp frag- ment including exon 13 and part of the upstream and downstream introns, whereas in the case of the two variants in the COL4A4 gene (c.931-2A>G in intron 15 and c.976-56A>G in intron 16) we amplified a 847 bp fragment encompassing both exons 16 and 17 and part of their flanking introns.
After digestion, the PCR products were cloned into the β-globin-pCDNA3.1 minigene, cut similarly, and the correctness of the construct was veri- fied by direct sequencing.
For each of the three variants, we retained one clone containing the wild-type allele and one with the mutation for the expression analysis The mutated minigene constructs, their corresponding wild-type versions or the empty vector were transfected in HEK293 cells and after 24 h total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) and retrotranscribed as previously reported (28).
The cDNA was then amplified using primers located on β-globin exons 2 and 3 in order to avoid eventual interference from the endogenous gene.
PCR fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on standard agarose gels and individual bands were excised and sequenced using the amplification primers Results In this study, using NGS (Ion Torrent PGM platform), we identified four ATS families harboring mutations in two distinct collagen IV genes (digenic model) (Fig.
1 and Table 1).
In three patients (proband of families 1, 2 and 4), we found a combination of two mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes, whereas in the remain- ing one (proband of family 3) we identified an asso- ciation of a COL4A5 and a COL4A3 mutation (Fig.
1 and Table 1).
Using Sanger sequencing, mutations were confirmed and segregation analysis was performed in all available family members (Fig.
1 and Table 1).Segre- gation analysis allowed us to verify which family mem- bers presented the same combination of variants in two (a) (b) (c) Alport syndrome (d) (e) Fig.

(a, b) Pedigrees of families 1 (a) and 2 (b) where probands show mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 on the same homologous chromosome (in cis configuration).
The p.(Gly1277Ser) variant is common to the two families, while the COL4A4 variants are: a splicing change in family 1 (c.931-2A>G) and a glycine substitution in family 2 (p.(Gly1233Arg)).
(c) Pedigree of family 3 where the proband presents the p.(Gly1277Ser) variant in COL4A3 inherited from the father and a de novo variant in COL4A5 (p.(Gly869Arg)).
(d) Pedigree of family 4 where the proband has mutations in COL4A3 (p.(Asn1508Ser)) and COL4A4 (p.(Arg1682Gln)) probably inherited independently (in trans configuration).
(e) Pedigree of family 5 where the proband shows intronic variants in COL4A4 (c.976-56A>G) and COL4A5 (c.780+5G>A) with a possible effect on splicing.

We also identified a case (family 5) suggestive of DI with intronic variants in two collagen IV genes outside the canonical GT–AG splice sites consensus sequences: c.976-56A>G in COL4A4 and c.780+5G>A in COL4A5 (Fig.
1 and Table 2).The c.976-56A>G change in COL4A4 created an alternative 5′ splice site according to all the used in silico programs (5/5) (Table 2), while four out of five programs pre- dicted a weakening of the 5′ canonical splice site for the c.780+5G>A variant in COL4A5 (Fig.
2 and Table 2) These variants were not reported in examined databases (dbSNP NCBI, 1000 genomes, ExAC and our in-house data set) Among the identified mutations, three had been already previously reported in ATS (Table 2) (29–31).
One of them (p.(Gly1277Ser)) in COL4A3 was found in three out of five families of our cohort combined with a second mutation in COL4A4 (families 1 and 2) or COL4A5 (family 3) (Fig.
1 and Table 1).This mis- sense change (rs190598500) is associated with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.06% in dbSNP142 and 0.03% in ExAC database.
Among identified COL4A4 novel variants, one (p.(Gly1233Arg)) is a missense change involving glycine residue in the Gly-X-Y triplet repeats of the collagenous domain (a.a.
62-1459) and the other (c.931-2A>G) is a splicing mutation consist- ing of an intronic substitution in the canonical accep- tor site (Table 2).
One novel mutation detected in COL4A3 (p.(Asn1508Ser)) is a missense change involv- ing a highly conserved residue (Asparagine) in the non-collagenous domain (aa 1440-1671) (Table 2).
This variant (rs200512461) is associated with a MAF of 0.02% in ExAC database Pathogenicity assessment of splicing variants by minigene assay To explore whether three of the intronic variants, reported in Table 2, could affect splicing, we decided to use a hybrid minigene approach to overcome the limitation of an undetectable expression level of COL4 transcripts in blood samples.
