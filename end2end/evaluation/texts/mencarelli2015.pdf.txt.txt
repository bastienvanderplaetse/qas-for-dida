ABSTRACT Background Alport syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous, progressive nephropathy caused by mutations in collagen IV genes, namely COL4A3 and COL4A4 on chromosome 2 and COL4A5 on chromosome X.
The wide phenotypic variability and the presence of incomplete penetrance suggest that a simple Mendelian model cannot completely explain the genetic control of this disease.
Therefore, we explored the possibility that Alport syndrome is under digenic control Methods Using massively parallel sequencing, we identiﬁed 11 patients who had pathogenic mutations in two collagen IV genes.
For each proband, we ascertained the presence of the same mutations in up to 12 members of the extended family for a total of 56 persons studied Results Overall, 23 mutations were found.
Individuals with two pathogenic mutations in different genes had a mean age of renal function deterioration intermediate with respect to the autosomal-dominant form and the autosomal-recessive one, in line with molecule stoichiometry of the disruption of the type IV collagen triple helix Conclusions Segregation analysis indicated three possible digenic segregation models: (i) autosomal inheritance with mutations on different chromosomes, resembling recessive inheritance (ﬁve families); (ii) autosomal inheritance with mutations on the same chromosome resembling dominant inheritance (two families) and (iii) unlinked autosomal and X-linked inheritance having a peculiar segregation (four families) This pedigree analysis provides evidence for digenic inheritance of Alport syndrome.
Clinical geneticists and nephrologists should be aware of this possibility in order to more accurately assess inheritance probabilities, predict prognosis and identify other family members at risk INTRODUCTION Alport syndrome is an inherited nephropathy char- acterised by haematuria, proteinuria, progressive renal failure and ultrastructural lesions of the glom- erular basement membrane (GBM), often asso- ciated with sensorineural deafness and ocular lesions.1 2 The primary defect resides in one of the α chains of type IV collagen produced by podo- cytes; the α chains assemble into a heterotrimeric triple helix (α3, α4 and α5) to create the three- dimensional network of the basement membrane.3 The α3 and α4 chains are encoded by COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes, located head-to-head on chromosome 2,4 while the α5 chain is encoded by COL4A5 on chromosome X.5 All three main models of Mendelian inheritance have been demonstrated in Alport syndrome: X-linked semi- dominant, autosomal recessive and autosomal dom- inant.6–9 X-linked semidominant inheritance is in COL4A5, while associated with mutations autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive inher- itance patterns are associated with one or two in either COL4A3 or mutations, COL4A4.4 10 respectively, Mutant alleles of all three primary loci demon- strate variable expressivity.
In particular, heterozy- gous COL4A5 women may be asymptomatic or have symptoms that range from haematuria alone to severe nephropathy leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).11 Similarly, heterozygous carriers of COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations, irrespective of gender, may be asymptomatic, may have haema- turia (carriers of recessive disease) or may progress to ESRD, although at a later age (apparently dom- inant form).12 13 A genotype–phenotype correl- ation between COL4A5 mutations and both the rate of progression to ESRD and the course of hearing loss and ocular lesions has been established in X-linked Alport syndrome, but, even within a single family, there is variability in disease sever- ity.11 14 Part of this variability may be due to a modiﬁer effect of functional polymorphisms in the (of which COL4A3 and three collagen chains COL4A4 are particularly rich) or in other structural proteins of GBM, such as podocin.15 Clariﬁcation of this relevant clinical variability warrants further investigation The wide phenotypic variability of patients with Alport syndrome and the presence of incomplete penetrance suggest that a simple Mendelian model is inadequate to explain the genetic control of this disease.
An alternative genetic model that may apply to Alport syndrome is digenic inheritance.
As explained by Schäffer in 2013, “inheritance is digenic when the variant genotypes at two loci explain the phenotypes of some patients and their unaffected (or more mildly affected) relatives more clearly than the genotypes at one locus alone”.16 Digenic inheritance has been demonstrated in numerous diseases such as deafness,17–21 retinitis pigmentosa22 non- compaction.23 During the past the knowledge of two-loci diseases has improved due genomic to comparative few years, ventricular extensive use of and left Copyright Article author (or their employer) 2015.

In par- ticular, in patients with various neuropsychiatric diseases, that an enrichment in copy number variants (CNVs) correlates with a more severe phenotype, that is, a speciﬁc microdeletion both predisposes to neuropsychiatric phenotypes as a single event and exacerbates neurodevelopmen- tal phenotypes in association with other deletions or duplications.24 25 Research into the genetic causes of disease has been facilitated by the recent development of massively parallel sequencing techniques.
This technology permits the sequencing of many genes simultaneously as a routine procedure9 12 26 and should accelerate the discovery and characterisation of disorders gov- erned by digenic inheritance.16 In the past, when Sanger sequencing was the dominant method, it was common to stop analysis when a single pathogenic mutation was identiﬁed; this approach prevented the ascertainment of individuals with muta- tions in more than one collagen gene.
Since 2011, we have been using massively parallel sequencing to evaluate the three colla- gen IV genes in patients with Alport syndrome, and this approach permitted us to identify 11 people who have muta- tions in two genes (molecular data for ﬁve patients have already been published).26 In this study, we examined the mutation pattern and clinical characteristics of these 11 patients and members of their extended families to explore the possibility that Alport syndrome is under digenic control MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and families Genetic counselling was performed in six European institutes (University of Siena, Italy; Hôpital Necker—Enfants Malades, Paris, France; Guy’s Hospital, London, England; Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK; Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands; and Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium) where patients with Alport syndrome were selected for mutation screening in the COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes according to clinical criteria These included a positive family history, a lamellated GBM, high tone sensorineural hearing loss, and lenticonus and macular ﬂecks on ophthalmoscopy.27 Eleven unrelated persons were found to have pathogenic mutations in more than one col- lagen gene.
These patients (four men and seven women, 3–55 years old) and members of their extended families were recruited for the present study, allowing us to construct 11 pedi- grees.
From all persons recruited, we collected clinical data regarding family status (proband or family relation), gender and age at inclusion (or death), kidney function (haematuria, pro- teinuria, chronic renal failure (CRF) or ESRD), hearing loss and ocular lesions; for all comorbidities, we recorded age at diagno- sis and eventual treatment.
Moreover, we obtained a sample of peripheral blood in EDTA tubes when possible Genomic DNA, ampliﬁcation and sequencing strategy Blood was stored frozen prior to the extraction of genomic DNA using QIAamp DNA Blood Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); this work was done at each institute for the families recruited there.
In Siena, genomic DNA was supplied directly from the institutional biobank Genomic DNA from probands was assessed for mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 by locus-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation followed by massively parallel sequencing.
Each participating institute ampliﬁed and sequenced the DNA for the probands it recruited.
Brieﬂy, the ALPORT MASTR kit (Multiplicom, Niel, Belgium) was used to amplify 149 amplicons (representing 150 about 4×50 ng starting with coding exons) of the three genes in a four-tube multiplex PCR reaction genomic DNA Ampliﬁcation products were sequenced using either a GS Junior System (454 Life Sciences, Roche) or an Ion Personal Genome Machine as described below Mutations of Probands 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 have already been reported in Morinière et al.26 Genomic DNA from family members was analysed by Sanger sequencing to determine whether these persons had the same mutations as the probands (PGM; Life Technologies), strategy for GS Junior 454 sequencing sequencing the COL4A3, COL4A4 and Our COL4A5 genes on a GS Junior system has been reported.9 Brieﬂy, ampliﬁcation products were diluted and then reampliﬁed with primers containing, at the 50 end, a multiplex identiﬁer sequence that barcodes the samples.
These PCR products for each proband were pooled in predeﬁned proportions according to the ALPORT MASTR protocol (Multiplicom).
These libraries were puriﬁed using Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter) and quantiﬁed using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Life Technologies), following the protocol of 454 Life Kit Sciences (http://454.com/downloads/my454/documentation/gs- junior-plus/454SeqSys_Amplicon-Library-Prep-MM_Apr2014.pdf) For GS Junior sequencing, libraries were diluted to a concen- tration of 1×107 PCR fragment molecules/mL, annealed to carrier beads (SeqCap EZ Pure Capture Bead Kit, Roche NimbleGen) and clonally ampliﬁed by emulsion PCR (emPCR) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (http://454.com/ downloads/my454/documentation/gs-junior/method-manuals/ GSJunioremPCRAmpliﬁcationMethodManualLib-A_March2012 pdf).
After ampliﬁcation, the beads carrying single-stranded DNA templates were enriched, counted and deposited into the PicoTiterPlate for sequencing (http://454.com/downloads/my454/ documentation/gs-junior/method-manuals/GSJuniorSequencing Manual_Jan2013.pdf).
Sequence reads were analysed using GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer, V.2.9 Ion PGM sequencing The strategy for sequencing the three collagen genes on an Ion PGM has recently been reported.26 Brieﬂy, ampliﬁcation pro- ducts were diluted, reampliﬁed using the universal primers included in ALPORT MASTR kit and pooled in predeﬁned pro- portions according to the ALPORT MASTR protocol.
This pool was used to prepare a barcoded library compatible with the Ion PGM according to the protocol of Life Technologies (http:// ioncommunity.lifetechnologies.com/community/login.jspa?referer= http://ioncommunity.lifetechnologies.com/community/protocols- home).26 Libraries were puriﬁed using Agencourt AMPure XP system and quantiﬁed using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) For Ion PGM sequencing, PCR fragments were diluted to 100 pM, annealed to carrier spheres (Ion Sphere Particles) and clonally ampliﬁed by emPCR using the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 kit (Life Technologies).
Spheres carrying single-stranded DNA templates were transferred to Ion 314 chips for sequencing using the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit V.2.
Data were processed using Torrent Suite software V.4.0, while postrun analysis was conducted using Torrent Variant Caller plug-in (V.4.0-r72895) In silico analyses Pathogenicity of variants was determined in accordance with the Clinical Molecular Genetics Society best practice guidelines.28 Pathogenicity was ascertained if the following criteria were met: in-frame deletions non-polymorphic missense mutations or 2 Mencarelli MA, et al.
