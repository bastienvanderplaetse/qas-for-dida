Introduction Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is an autoso- mal recessive immune disorder with defective lymphocyte granule– mediated cytotoxicity.1,2 Several genes have been implicated in FHL FHL2, -3, -4, and -5 and Griscelli syndrome involve PRF1, UNC13D (MUNC13-4), STX11, STXBP2, and RAB27A, respectively.3-6 All of these genes, except for PRF1, play a role in the degranulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which affects the precise steps of docking, priming, and fusion of the cytotoxic lymphocytes to the target cell.7,8 Perforin is then released from granules to assist in the penetration and delivery of granzymes into the cytosol of the target cell, where the granzymes cleave key substrates to initiate apoptotic cell death.3,7 An uncompromised and coordinated function of all of these molecules is essential for normal lymphocyte cytotoxic activity.
Although it is well known that FHL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, symptomatic heterozygous mutation carriers have been presented in several reports.9,10 In these cases, additional synergistic defects in the molecules of the cytotoxic pathway may contribute to the ﬁnal development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which sug- gests a digenic inheritance of FHL In digenic inheritance, the combination of concurrent partial defects in 2 genes within the same pathway gives rise to a clinical phenotype, whereas a heterozygous state in either of the genes alone results in a less severe phenotype or none at all.
Examples of a digenic mode of inheritance have been described for an array of disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, holoprosencephaly, deafness, epider- molysis bullosa, Hirschsprung disease, insulin resistance, and polycystic kidney disease.11,12 To investigate potential digenic inheritance for FHL, we reviewed patients with clinical FHL and identiﬁed those with heterozygous variants in 2 FHL-associated genes; we then examined the age of onset, defective degranulation, perforin levels, and natural killer (NK) cell function activity compared with patients with one (heterozygous) or 2 sequence variants in a speciﬁc gene We present data suggestive of synergistic heterozygosity in FHL between 2 genes involved in cytotoxic lymphocyte degranulation Study design This was a retrospective chart review, approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center institutional review board, which included 2701 patients referred by their physicians for genetic testing because of clinically suspected FHL.
This cohort included affected individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in a single gene, single heterozygous individuals with a single mutation in one gene, and double heterozygous (digenic) individuals with 2 heterozygous mutations in 2 separate genes.
We analyzed clinical information, clinical immunology testing results, and/or genetic testing results that were available for these patients.13-15 Interpretation of sequence variants was based on the algorithm described by the Human Genome Variation Society (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/ recs.html) and included the use of predictions with Alamut 2.2.2 (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) for SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant),16 PolyPhen-217 and the Grantham Scale.18 Alamut also integrates databases for Submitted May 5, 2014; accepted May 30, 2014.
