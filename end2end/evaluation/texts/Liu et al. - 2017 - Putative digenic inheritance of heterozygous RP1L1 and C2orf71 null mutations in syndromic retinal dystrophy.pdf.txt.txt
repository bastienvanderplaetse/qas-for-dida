ABSTRACT Background: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration and can occur in non-syndromic and syndromic forms.
Syndromic RP is accompanied by other symptoms such as intellectual disability, hearing loss, or congenital abnormalities.
Both forms are known to exhibit complex genetic interactions that can modulate the penetrance and expressivity of the phenotype Materials and methods: In an individual with atypical RP, hearing loss, ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, whole exome sequencing was performed.
The candidate pathogenic variants were tested by developing an in vivo zebrafish model and assaying for retinal and cerebellar integrity Results: Exome sequencing revealed a complex heterozygous protein-truncating mutation in RP1L1, p.[(Lys111Glnfs*27; Gln2373*)], and a heterozygous nonsense mutation in C2orf71, p.(Ser512*) Mutations in both genes have previously been implicated in autosomal recessive non-syndromic RP, raising the possibility of a digenic model in this family.
Functional testing in a zebrafish model for two key phenotypes of the affected person showed that the combinatorial suppression of rp1l1 and c2orf71l induced discrete pathology in terms of reduction of eye size with concomitant loss of rhodopsin in the photoreceptors, and disorganization of the cerebellum Conclusions: We propose that the combination of heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in these genes drives syndromic retinal dystrophy, likely through the genetic interaction of at least two loci Haploinsufficiency at each of these loci is insufficient to induce overt pathology ARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 September 2015 Revised 22 December 2015 Accepted 1 February 2016 KEYWORDS Cerebellum; ciliopathy; digenic inheritance; hearing loss; retinitis pigmentosa; zebrafish Introduction Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an important cause of visual impair- ment with a prevalence of 1:4,000.1 The disorder is typically driven by degeneration of the rod photoreceptors, followed by cone cell death in a more advanced stage of the disease.
The age of onset and the degree of progression are highly variable.
Some forms are congenital, but most forms of RP start with night blindness in young adulthood, followed by mid-peripheral visual field loss and tunnel vision.
In many instances, electrophysiological studies have revealed pathology that precedes gross structural defects in the photoreceptor and a concomitant asymptomatic latency period Finally, also central vision can decrease, which may result in complete blindness.
During funduscopy, pigment deposits and attenuated retinal vessels can be seen, although this can be absent at early stages of the disease.
The diagnosis can be established by electroretinography (ERG).2 Persons with RP can have additional features, consisting of hearing impairment, dysmorphisms, intel- lectual disability or congenital abnormalities, collectively called syndromic RP.
Syndromic RP is a genetic heterogeneous disease; at present, >80 genes are known to be involved, with most of them contributing mutations under an autosomal recessive inheritance paradigm (https://sph.uth.edu/Retnet/, November 2014).
Exome sequencing is a powerful tool to analyze all known genes involved in syndromic RP and to identify new candidate genes.3 Here we present an individual with syndromic retinal dystrophy in whom exome sequencing revealed heterozygous null variants in RP1L1 (MIM 608581; NM_178857.5) and C2orf71 (MIM 613425; NM_001029883.2), two genes implicated in recessive forms of RP, for which haploinsufficiency at either locus does not impair vision.
Functional testing revealed likely additive and multiplica- tive effects in different functional systems for these two transcripts, suggesting that the combinatorial effect of haploinsufficiency at the two loci might be the candidate driver mechanism CONTACT Frans P.

P.LIU ET AL Materials and methods Clinical investigations Clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study was approved by the Danish Research Ethical Committee (refer- ence numbers KF 01-234/02 and KF 01-108/03).
Written informed consent was obtained from the proband and her relatives.
The female proband (age 35) was first audiometrically tested at age 1.5 years and treated with hearing aids.
Later, she was found to have profound hearing loss, and hearing aids were not used after the age of 5 years.
Eye examinations took place at regular intervals, including funduscopy, visual field analysis, and electroretinography.
Neurological examinations included a cerebral MRI-scan at 23 years of age Copy number variation and other genotyping studies A 450k comparative genomic hybridization array (Agilent oli- goarray, Santa Clara, CA, USA) analysis was performed, as well as targeted analysis of mitochondrial DNA variants at positions 1555, 3243 and 7445 implicated previously in forms of hearing loss (http://www.mitomap.org/bin/view.pl/MITOMAP/ WebHome).
In addition, Sanger sequencing of CEP290 (LCA, Meckel-Gruber and Joubert syndrome), OPA1 (optic atrophy), GJB2 (hearing loss), WFS1 (Wolfram syndrome or nonsyndro- mic deafness) and ZCD2 (Wolfram syndrome) was performed, as well as Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) of OPA1 and WFS1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ omim).
Previously published mutations for LCA (version 6.0; 451 mutations in 11 genes, November 2007), Usher syndrome (version 6.0; 612 mutations in 9 genes, October 2009), autosomal recessive RP (version 5; 594 mutations in 19 genes, June 2010), and autosomal dominant RP (version2; 385 mutations in 16 genes, July 2010) were analyzed by Asper Biotech (Tartu, Estonia), using the Allele-specific Primer Extension (APEX) method (for references and further details, see: http://www asperbio.com/asper-ophthalmics) (variant reads proportion >80%) and compound heterozygous variants.
Furthermore, genes known to be implicated in ret- inal diseases, hearing impairment and intellectual disability were analyzed for the presence of causal variants The variants identified in the proband (ID: 062125) were registered in the respective Leiden Open-access Variation Databases: http://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/eye/home.php? select_db=RP1L1 (for RP1L1) and http://grenada.lumc.nl/ LOVD2/eye/home.php?select_db=C2orf71 (for C2orf71) Modeling phenotypes in zebrafish embryos rp1l1 (guide sequence: sequence: and c2orf71l Two morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) were designed and ordered from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR) to suppress the expres- sion of zebrafish homolog genes: a splicing blocker against rp1l1 (rp1l1 SB: 5′- AAGAAATAAAGTCCTGACCTTGCGC -3′, effi- ciency was examined by reverse transcription PCR (S1 Fig.), with rp1l1-E1F: 5′- GCTCGCAGTCTTCGAGTCTT -3′, primers rp1l1-E3R: 5′- TGATCTCGGTGGACCATTGG -3′, rp1l1-i1R: 5′- TTTCATCCTCCGAGCCACAC -3′.) and a translation blocker against C2orf71-like (c2orf71l TB: 5′- GGAGAGC AGCCCATTTCAGATAGAT -3′).
CRISPR were designed to 5′- TGGACTCGATG knockout CAGTCACGA -3′) 5′- (guide AGTAGTGTTCTCCCCCGTGA -3′)4 (Knockout efficiency was examined by PCR (S2 Fig.), with primers rp1l1-CRtestF: 5′- GGC TTTTTCGACGCTGATCC -3′, 5′- TCTG GGCGTTGTGATGGTAC -3′, 5′- GCT GCTTGATGTGCCTTCAC -3′, c2orf71l-CRtestR: 5′- GTCAG ATGGAGTGGTCTGCC -3′.).
MOs or CRISPR gRNA plus Cas9 RNA were microinjected into the yolk of zebrafish embryos at 1–8 cell stage, and then the convergent extension phenotype was examined at 10 somite stage (10 ss) as described before.5,6 At 5 days post images of zebrafish larvae were taken to measure eye size.
Larvae were then either fixed in Dent’s for whole mount immunostaining with anti-acetylated-tubulin (Sigma T7451), or in 4% PFA for coronal cryosectioning, followed by histoimmunostaining with anti- rhodopsin (ZIRC, zpr-3) rp1l1-CRtestR: c2orf71l-CRtestF: fertilization (5 dpf), lateral Whole exome sequencing Whole exome sequencing of the affected individual, from whom written consent was obtained, was performed on a 5500XL sequencing platform from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The exome was enriched according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the SureSelect Human All Exon v4 Kit (50 Mb; Santa Clara, CA, USA).
LifeScope soft- ware v2.1 from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to map color space reads on the hg19 reference genome assembly and call single nucleotide variants All variants with coverage above five reads were included Variants were prioritized by excluding all variants present in fewer than 20% of reads, as well as all intergenic, intronic (other than canonical splice sites) variants and alterations leading to synonymous amino acid changes.
Variants with a frequency >0.5% in dbSNP version 135 or the Nijmegen in- house database consisting of 1,152 exomes were also excluded The remaining data were analyzed for homozygous variants Results Clinical features of proband with syndromic retinal dystrophy We examined a 35-year-old woman born to healthy unrelated parents of Scandinavian ancestry.
She was born without perina- tal complications as the first child after an uneventful pregnancy in week 42.
The family history was negative regarding hearing and vision problems.
At the age of 1.5 years she presented with a bilateral hearing loss of 80–90 dB and was initially treated with hearing aids.
Later, she was found to have profound hearing loss, and hearing aids were not used after the age of five.
She com- municates with Swedish sign language.
Absent otoacoustic emis- sions indicated a cochlear involvement in the deafness At the age of 1 year strabismus was diagnosed, and at 4 years of age nystagmus was documented by an ophthalmolo- gist.
When she was 12, she had visual problems in scotopic conditions and decreased visual acuity, and she was clinically suspected to have Usher syndrome.
At age 18, funduscopy revealed an atypical retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with bull’s eye- like macular abnormalities and pale optic discs (Figure 1A, B) Bone spicules were absent.
The ERG showed progressive rod and cone dystrophy.
At the age of 21 she had a bilateral visual acuity of 0.02, excentric fixation, nystagmus, light adaptation problems, and night blindness.
At age 23, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was noted, reminiscent of RPE changes in Leber congenital amaurosis.
She did not show facial dysmorphic features Neurological examination showed unilateral (left side) vestibular areflexia, tremor and low normal intelligence.
She has anxiety, a mild degree of depression, displays some obses- sive behavior and has attended a psychiatrist several times She works as an assistant in a stable with horses.
A cerebral MRI-scan at 23 years of age demonstrated vermis atrophy and a smaller cerebellum.
There was a normal distribution of white and grey matter.
Pons, brainstem, visual cortex, inner ear structures, optic nerve and acoustic nerve were normal She has one healthy younger sister, aged 31 Heterozygous null mutations in C2orf71 and RP1L1 in syndromic retinal dystrophy CNV analysis did not reveal significant deletions or duplica- tions.
Similarly, we found no mutations in the genes analyzed by Sanger sequencing, or in mitochondrial variants at posi- tions 1555, 3243 and 7445.
Finally, the APEX analysis of genes implicated previously in LCA, USH, adRP and arRP (known in 2010) also revealed no causal variants.
In the exome sequencing OPHTHALMIC GENETICS 129 results of the affected individual, the mean coverage was 91× per target with a median coverage of 71×.
In total, we identified 49,333 variants.
After applying quality filtering and excluding common and synonymous variants, 252 variants remained (Supplemental Table 1 – online only).
Under the assumption of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, two variants were identified in RP1L1 (c.326_327insT, p.(Lys111Glnfs*27) and c.7117C>T, p.(Gln2373*)) (Table 1, Supplemental Figure – online only) Segregation analysis showed that they were both present on the maternal allele (Figure 1C, D).
By analyzing for the presence of variants in genes implicated in intellectual disability, hearing impairment and inherited retinal disease, a heterozygous stop mutation in C2orf71 (c.1535C>A, p.(Ser512*)), a gene previously shown to be involved in autosomal recessive RP.

P.LIU ET AL by whole exome sequencing, did not reveal a second mutation The list of the intellectual disability, hearing impairment and inherited retinal disease associated genes and their coverage data are presented in Supplemental Tables 2–4 – online only.
The median overlap of the targets of these genes were 95%, 96%, 97%, with a median coverage of 74×, 71×, 73×, respectively Additive effect of morpholino knockdown of rp1l1 and c2orf71l on convergent extension and eye size in zebrafish The presence of RP1L1 p.[(Lys111Glnfs*27; Gln2373*)] and C2orf71, p.(Ser512*), both of which are by definition pathogenic in the context of autosomal recessive RP, raised the possibility of digenic inheritance of syndromic retinal dystrophy in this indi- vidual.
To test this hypothesis in vivo, we sought to model the individual’s phenotypes in zebrafish embryos.
We first per- formed reciprocal BLAST searches, through which we identified a sole ortholog of each: rp1l1 and c2orf71l (51% similarity with 36% identity, and 60% similarity with 40% identity, respectively) Next, we designed morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) for both genes: a splice blocker for rp1l1, and a translational blocker for c2orf71l due to the lack of useable designs for a splice blocker.
As a first test, we evaluated the impact of suppression of each of the two genes on early gastrulation; both genes have been shown to be relevant to ciliary function,7–9 perturbation of which induces convergent extension (CE) defects in mid-somitic embryos.10,11 Consistent with this expectation, suppression of each of rp1l1 and c2orf71l induced CE defects; embryos with an expansion of the “gap angle” (>45°) were considered affected and were plotted as such (Figure 2A, B; triplicated).
Lack of available reagents, limited expression,7,8,12,13 and relative large gene size precluded the generation of rescue constructs to test for MO specificity.
As such, we sought an alternative method, which was employed to induce small deletions in these two genes by CRISPR/Cas9 Masked evaluation of embryos showed that CRISPR mutants phenocopied MOs.
Relevant to the human genotype, 20% (rp1l1) and 43% (c2orf71l) of the single MOs showed CE defects, whereas double suppression induced CE in 64% of embryos, a significant difference (p < 0.05) that appears to reflect an additive effect of the two MOs Next, we sought to assess this possible interaction in the context of pathology directly relevant to the affected individual, by evaluating the eye (macro- and microscopically).
Suppression of numerous RP-associated genes in zebrafish gives rise to microphthalmia in zebrafish embryos.14,15 Consistent with this, suppression of either rp1l1 or c2orf71l caused 10–20% reduction in eye size at 5 days post fertilization (5 dpf) (Figure 2C, D) Reminiscent of the CE interaction, co-suppression of both genes gave rise to a 34% reduction of eye size.
This is a significant reduction of eye size compared to the effects of suppressing the single genes (p < 0.001), and also suggestive for an additive effect Moreover, whereas each MO exhibited disorganization and likely partial loss of photoreceptors as visualized by rhodopsin staining in cryosectioned retinas, double morphants had no appreciable rhodopsin staining (Figure 2C).
Once again, these phenotypes could be reproduced in our CRISPR/Cas9 mutants (data not shown) Synergistic effect of morpholino knockdown of rp1l1 and c2orf71l on cerebellar development in zebrafish Finally, we turned our attention to the cerebellar atrophy of our individual, a phenotype that is, to our knowledge, not asso- ciated typically with recessive mutations in either RP1L116 or C2orf71.8,13 Suppression of either gene and imaging of the cerebellum gave no or modest pathology at 5 dpf, with 0% (rp1l1) and 21% (c2orf71l) of embryos exhibiting defects in size and shape of the cerebellum; by contrast, concomitant suppression of both genes induced cerebellar pathology in 39% of embryos a significant exacerbation (p < 0.05) that is not additive (Figure 2E, F).
CRISPR-mediated deletion of either gene also gave rise to cerebellar defects (data not shown) Discussion In an individual with a syndromic form of RP we identified heterozygous variants in two genes encoding ciliary proteins, namely RP1L1, p.[(Lys111Glnfs*27; Gln2373*)], and C2orf71, p.(Ser512*).
Mutations in genes encoding ciliary proteins are known to cause a wide spectrum of diseases, including RP, hearing impairment, intellectual disability and cerebellar abnormalities, making them obvious candidates for the pheno- type in this person.
RP1L1 is expressed primarily in cones and rods.17 The first 350 amino acids are conserved and share high similarity with RP1, a protein that can be mutated in autosomal dominant and recessive forms of RP.18–20 This conserved region contains two doublecortin domains.
For RP1, it was shown that these domains are important for stabilization of the microtubule-based axoneme in the photoreceptor outer segment.12 RP1 and RP1L1 co-localize to the axoneme, but RP1L1 is also present in the connecting cilium.7 A subset of heterozygous mutations in RP1L1 are known to cause autoso- mal dominant occult macular dystrophy (MIM 613587), a disease characterized by progressive decrease of visual acuity down to 0.1, a normal fundus, but specific ERG- and optical coherence tomography (OCT) abnormalities.21 Recently, other homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in this gene were identified to cause autosomal recessive RP.16 The C2orf71 gene is predominantly expressed in the retina, and the protein is localized in the primary cilia of transfected human retinal pigmented epithelial cells.8,13 Mutations in C2orf71 are known to cause autosomal recessive RP (MIM 613428).13 Although, we cannot fully exclude a mutation on the other allele of these genes (e.g.
in a non-coding region) or a de novo variant in another gene leading to a dominant disorder, the most parsimonious interpretation of our data is a digenic model, not only because of the obvious deleterious nature of the discovered mutations in two ciliary genes but because of the synthetic cerebellar phenotype that could only be observed in the double morphant/mutant.
Naturally, this postulate can only be substantiated by the discovery of additional families with similar mutational architecture Thus far, a limited number of examples of digenic inheri- tance have been reported.22 Double heterozygous mutations in PRPH2 and ROM1 cause RP.23 Usher syndrome can be the result of double heterozygous mutations in CDH23 and PCDH15.24 Another type of digenic inheritance is reported OPHTHALMIC GENETICS 131 Figure 2.
