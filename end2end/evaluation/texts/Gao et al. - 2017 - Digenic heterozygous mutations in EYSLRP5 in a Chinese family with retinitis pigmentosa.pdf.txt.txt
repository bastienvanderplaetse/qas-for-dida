Digenic heterozygous  mutations in EYS/LRP5 in a Chinese family with retinitis pigmentosa Int J Ophthalmol  2017;10(2):325-328 Dear Editor, I am Dr.
Ji-Hong Wu, from the Department of Ophthal- mology, Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University, China I write to present a case report of retinitis pigmentosa (RP)  caused by novel digenic heterozygous mutations in a Chinese  family RP, the most frequently described inherited retinal dystrophies  (IRD), shows a prevalence of 1/3500 to 1/5000 worldwide,  but statistics from the Beijing Eye Research Center show that  the incidence of RP in China is approximately 1 in 1000[1] RP commences with progressive night blindness, followed  by gradual loss of peripheral visual fields (VF) and complete  blindness in the later stage[2].
RP can be transmitted via  autosomal dominant (24%), autosomal recessive (41%), and  X-linked (22%)[3].
The remaining 12% of cases are presumed  to cause by non-genetic factors, non-Mendelian inheritance  (for example, mitochondrial or de novo mutations) or complex  inheritance (digenic or polygenic inheritance) [4] To date, more than 60 genes have been associated with RP.
EYS  is considered to be one of the most prevalent mutated genes  worldwide[5].
The EYS gene contains 43 exons and spanning  over 2000 bp within the RP25 locus (6q12).
EYS encodes a  protein of 3165 amino acids, which is localized to the outer  segment of the photoreceptor cell layer[6].
EYS mutations  demonstrate great genotypic and phenotypic varieties, and are  one of the primary major gene responsible for recessive RP[7] The low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-related receptor-5 (LRP5),  a member of the LDL receptor superfamily, is a co-receptor  for Wnt ligands involved in the wingless (Wnt) signaling  pathway, which is essential for the development of vascular  endothelial cells, Müller cells and retinal interneurons[8].
Loss- of-function mutations in LRP5 can cause familial exudative  vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) in humans in the way of recessive  RP[9], but no mutations have been identified in RP Diverse diagnostic strategies are used in RP cases.
Custom- designed re-sequencing microarrays is an effective alternative  for the detection of novel mutations, although this approach  is limited to a known set of genes.
Sanger sequencing is an  indispensable and the most reliable method for identifying  causative gene mutations, although it is not affordable due  to the great genetic heterogeneity of RP.
However, most of  these limitations can now be overcome with next-generation  sequencing (NGS), which has become widely used and  facilitated the discovery of many causative genes and gene  variants of complex traits[10].
In this study, we conducted a  high-throughput sequence capture microarray with 99.67%  coverage of all exons and combined with NGS to identify the  possible causal genes in a Chinese family with RP, in which  the cause of the disease had not been determined yet Our study involved a Chinese family consisting of the proband  and his unaffected parents.
The proband, a 30-year-old man,  received a diagnosis of RP on the basis of clinical symptoms,  such as decreased vision, night blindness, red-green blindness  and the results of a comprehensive ocular examination,  as described elsewhere[11].
Fundus examination revealed  attenuated vessels and bone spicule-shaped pigment deposits  in the peripheral retina in both eyes (Figure 1); spectral- domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) line scans of  both eyes through the central maculae showed a profound loss  of photoreceptor layer structure in the retina.
The remaining  photoreceptors and the transitional zone were only seen in the  macular zone (Figure 1); No detectable cone or rod responses  were recorded by electroretinography (ERG) in the patient  (Figure 2).
All of the retinal phenotypes of the patient were  typical for RP without any other ocular abnormalities.
His  parents reported no major issues with vision, and there was no  family history of ocular or systemic diseases 325 Int J Ophthalmol,    Vol.

Fifteen  heterozygous mutations and two homozygous mutations,  including five novel and eleven known mutations, were iden- tified.
After subjecting the results to a pipeline of database  filtering, including the dbSNP137, HapMap Project, 1000  Genome Project, YH database and Exome Variant Server  databases, a novel nonsense mutation c.7723+1G>A in the EYS  gene and a formerly reported missense mutation c.3361A>G  in the LRP5 gene[9] were identified as potentially causative  mutations for RP (Figure 3, Table 2).
Sanger sequencing for  these two mutations in his parents showed that his mother  carried the EYS c.7723+1G>A mutation in the heterozygous  state, and his father carried the LRP5 c.3361 A>G mutation in  the heterozygous state The advent of NGS has significantly increased the possibilities  of identification of many rare disease genes, including genes  for retinal dystrophies.
NGS is a high-throughput tool which  is capable of sequencing large gene pools efficiently and  precisely, so it provides large data sets.
Therefore, NGS has  become a powerful and cogent tool for elucidating thorough  mutation profiles for heterogeneous diseases.
The clinical  and genetic complexity of RP makes the accurate diagnosis  Figure 2 ERG results of the right and left eyes of the proband.
Both  dark-adapted and light-adapted responses were non-detectable Genomic DNA from the family was extracted from the  peripheral blood using a standard method[12].
The index patient  was analyzed firs.
We performed a targeted NGS approach  on the patient.
The NGS strategy included 129 target genes,  326 Figure 3 Mutations identified in the EYS and LRP5 genes  A: Protein alignment for the mutations identified in EYS  (left) and LRP5  (right) gene; B: Sequencing results of the novel mutation in the EYE gene (MU1) and LRP5 gene (MU2).

In this  study, we comprehensively screened 129 genes involved in  common inherited nonsyndromic eye diseases and successfully  identified 2 potentially causative mutations for RP: EYS  c.7723+1G>A and LRP5 c.3361 A>G The types of EYS mutations identified in RP include missense,  nonsense, microdeletions and insertions, 5’UTR variations,  and copy number variations, such as midsize genomic rear- rangements[13].
The onset ages of RP caused by EYS varied  greatly from 6- to 62-year-old[14].
In the present study, we  detected a novel splicing mutation of EYS c.7723+1G>A in the  proband in a heterozygous state.
The potential pathogenicity  of the filtered variants was then interpreted according to  the existing and proposed American College of Medical  Genetics and Genomics guidelines.
Result shows that EYS  c.7723+1G>A is splice site mutation, which may change the  splicing way of the RNA precursor, resulting in abnormal  protein coding.
However, his unaffected mother is also in a  heterozygous state, implying that heterozygous mutation of  EYS c.7723+1G>A alone may not be sufficient to cause RP Mutations in the gene LRP5 have been shown to be responsible  for both FEVR and osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome,  a disease that is characterized by blindness and loss of bone  mass[15].
Heterozygous mutation of LRP5 c.3361 A>G has been  reported in FEVR but not in RP.
However, this previous study  only tested the coding exons and adjacent intronic regions of  the FZD4 and LRP5 genes.
Thus, mutations in the intronic or  regulatory regions could not be detected, and we cannot rule  out the possibility of the existence of other mutations at work In our study, we found that the mutation was present in both  the proband and his unaffected father in heterozygous status,  suggesting that single heterozygous mutation of LRP5 c.3361  A>G might not be sufficient to cause RP or FEVR Our data suggest a possible digenic form of inheritance for  RP, whereby the co-existence of EYS c.7723+1G>A and LRP5  c.3361A>G heterozygous mutations can result in RP.
Because  EYS c.7723+1G>A is a splicing mutation and LRP5 c.3361A>G  is missense mutation, we hypothesize this result can be  explained by the fact that the LRP5 c.3361A>G mutation  affects only part of the mRNA, and the normal amount of  LRP5 protein is sufficient to sustain proper functioning of  the cells.
The EYS splicing mutation may affect pre-mRNA  splicing and mRNA stability and translation efficiency; as a  result, normal LRP5 protein is decreased, whereas abnormal  protein accumulates and eventually leads to RP.
However,  there may be other unknown mechanisms responsible for  the phenotype observed.
This study may provide for the first  time evidence for the digenic or polygenic nature of this  disease, which further extended our current understanding of  the genetic basis of RP, although more samples are needed to  further understand the mutation spectrum of RP 327 Int J Ophthalmol,    Vol.

These results enhance our  current understanding of the genetic basis of RP and provide  helpful clues for designing future studies to further investigate  genetic factors associated with familial RP ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We would like to thank the patient and his parents for their  collaboration.
